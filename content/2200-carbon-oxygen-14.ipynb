    "Notably, it is only the Coulomb term that explicitly depends upon a nucleon flavour (the proton). This hints at a symmetry of the strong interaction - that the Hamiltonian is degenerate with respect to nucleon charge. It is not an _exact_ symmetry; the mass of the neutron is slightly greater than that of the proton, and thus the eigenvalues of the strong Hamiltonian are distinct. This difference can be treated as a _perturbation_ of an exact symmetry, called Isospin {math}`I` for its close resemblance of the spin-{math}`\\frac{1}{2}` representation.{cite:ps}`wigner_consequences_1937` In this model, protons and neutrons form eigenstates of the spin-doublet system with {math}`3` projection {math}`I_3 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}`.
