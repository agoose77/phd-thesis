    "In {ref}`liquid-drop-model`, the semi-empirical mass formula was introduced. Notably, it is only the Coulomb term of {eq}`semi-empirical-mass-formula` that explicitly depends upon a nucleon flavour (the proton). This hints at a symmetry of the strong interaction - that the Hamiltonian is degenerate with respect to nucleon charge. It is not an _exact_ symmetry; the mass of the neutron is slightly greater than that of the proton, and thus the eigenvalues of the strong Hamiltonian are distinct. This difference can be treated as a _perturbation_ of an exact symmetry, called Isospin {math}`I` for its close resemblance of the spin-{math}`\\frac{1}{2}` representation.{cite:ps}`wigner_consequences_1937` In this model, protons and neutrons form eigenstates of the spin-doublet system with {math}`3` projection {math}`I_3 \\pm \\frac{1}{2}`.

    "One of the earliest conjectures as to the existence of molecular structures in {math}`{}^{14}\\text{C}` was that of a near-threshold isomeric state at ~17.24 MeV given by {cite:authorpars}`von_oertzen_two-center_1996`. This prediction followed from the postulate that bound _multimers_ could be formed by adding helium isotopes to the known beryllium dimer structures, whereby the additional valence neutrons would form covalent bonds between the next two {math}`\\alpha`-particles. An exploration of the relationship between clustering and the deformed harmonic oscillator (DHO) model has been performed by {cite:authorpars}`freer_relationship_1995-2`, demonstrating that shell-model structure appears within the DHO for integer deformation ratios {math}`\\omega_x:\\omega_y\\omega_z`. Subsequent work has further postulated the existence of a linear chain structure at a {math}`3:1` deformation, whereby three quartets of paired protons and neutrons occupy the leading closed degenerate shell-model shells, and valence neutrons lie on the perpendicular orbitals. This chain is predicted to form an {math}`\\pi`-orbital, which is expected to be the lowest-energy linear chain system.{cite:ps}`von_oertzen_nuclear_2006`"
