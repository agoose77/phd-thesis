    "The provision of an online teaching resource for practical laboratory experience transcends the immediate problem of supporting distance-learning students during a public health emergency. Through a carefully defined environment, experiment designers can guide students towards successful application of learned theory, but also towards \"interesting\" or educational failure modes.{cite:ps}`de_jong_physical_2013-1` Due to the curated nature of the virtual environment, these failure modes can be introduced in accordance with the objectives of the laboratory; educators can _teach_ through failure in a controlled manner. Furthermore, by designing failure into an experiment, educators are given the ability to prepare in advance for adverse outcomes, and guide students through the experience. This is particular relevant in the event that experiment failures are irrecoverable, e.g. loss of experimental data, or damage to the electronics of a high-voltage power supply. Through the careful selection of a basis of representative failure modes, students can be better prepared for failures in a real-world experiment, which are often multifactorial and represent poor educational experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the removal of the physical constraints associated with on-premise in-person teaching, online laboratory experiences are free to explore experiment designs that are infeasible or indeed impossible to realise in a conventional setting. Experiments can be simplified to eliminate confusing details such as cumbrous software, or simplify characteristics of the model such that the results are easier or more convenient to interpret e.g. increasing the rate of a decay process.{cite:ps}`de_jong_physical_2013-1` Furthermore, it is possible to treat physical invariants as model parameters that students can interact with e.g. the material properties of a radiation absorber. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to providing educators with greater freedoms over experimental outcomes and narrative towards deeper understanding of fundamental concepts, a significant benefit of virtual experiments is the improved efficiency associated with reduced setup time, and time-to-results. Nuclear physics experiments are typically constrained by the time required to configure the necessary detection equipment, and the subsequent interval over which the measurement must be gathered. In some cases, the time investment required to perform a measurement may serve as a lens through which to develop planning and reflection skills.{cite:ps}`de_jong_physical_2013-1` In the virtual laboratory, educators can choose whether to impose these restrictions. Where hybrid learning is possible, it may be favourable to distinguish between virtual and practical experiments through these real-world constraints in order to prioritise different learning outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Undergraduate laboratories typically imposes significant constraints on the teaching schedule due to the long sessions required to setup, measure, and restore the experimental equipment. This, in turn, places a higher cost on mistakes during these sessions, and prevents the students from repeating an experiment with the knowledge learned through failure. The ability to revisit experiments has been recognised by students as a positive aspect of virtual laboratories. Some students have also reported that the ability to work alone was a preferential mode of learning that was not possible in the physical laboratory due to equipment constraints.{cite:ps}`aayiksoy_impact_2017` Alongside this, research has shown that communication opportunities within virtual laboratories are highly correlated with student learning achievement; care must be taken by educators to ensure that these opportunities are established within the virtual space.{cite}`klein_studying_2021-1`"
