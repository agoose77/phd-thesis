    "Each page of the O-Lab deployment consisted of three main sections: the sidebar, the navbar, and the main-content (see {numref}`olab-layout`). The sidebar, which was hidden by default but could be maximised, was used to present a set of global navigation links between the various experiments and other resource links, such as the laboratory manual. These links could be customised according to each deployment; different teaching groups made use of different manuals, and so the links generated in the sidebar could be configured for each user. The navbar was used for _local_ navigation within the current notebook. For the experiment notebooks, this was used to separate the different stages of an experiment. Within each page, the per-page content was shown in the main-content region, \n",
    "which comprised a grid system populated by discrete \"cards\". Each card contained rich content, e.g. rich-text; interactive widgets; or images; which was used to convey the relevant information about the experimental setup, analysis tasks, and equipment configuration to the user. An example notebook that employs this card system can be seen in {numref}`olab-layout`."

    "As a first iteration of the online laboratory concept, a set of six preliminary experiments with close resemblance to their real-world counterparts was designed, listed in {numref}`list-of-experiments`. In addition to reducing the scope of the laboratory design, replicating on-premise experiments also offers the opportunity for students to prepare for practical in-situ experimentation, with an understanding of the real-world constraints. The landing page of each notebook was designed to introduce the experiment, and discuss the various tasks that the user must complete (see {numref}`olab-detector-comparison`. Rendered schematics of the experiment were generated by the the team, and included in the introduction to give a visualisation of what a practical experiment configuration would look like."
