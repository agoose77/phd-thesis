    "# Noise and Baseline Removal\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in {ref}`content:get-architecture`, the AGET chip provides four additional channels for measuring the electronic noise. These channels can be used to eliminate some of the electronic noise inherent within the system. A number of noise removal strategies are discussed in {cite:ps}`giovinazzo_get_2016-1`, and establishes that an average over the set of FPN channels per-chip is optimal. It was this strategy that was employed to for noise removal (see {numref}`fpn-removal-micromegas`)."

Therefore, in order to identify the region of baseline that would be linearly subtracted from the recorded signal, a local variance was computed for the channel samples, with a window of 96 cells (see {numref}`baseline-estimate-micromegas`)."
