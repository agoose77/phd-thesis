    "Just as there exists a challenge in supporting students with installation and management of software packages, the same concerns are present when working with a team of developers to build software. Modern software development typically involves the usage of solutions that guarantee the reproducibility of an environment, such as `conda`, or Node JS's `npm`.{cite:ps}`gruning_practical_2018` These package managers make use of a \"lockfile\" to solve a set of software dependencies ahead-of-time for a known set of architectures (in the later case, exclusively Node). In doing so, it is guaranteed that users of these lockfiles can reproduce the same environment, avoiding the often seen \"this works on my machine\" complaint. Of these two examples, Conda is the more general; it provides binary packages for multiple platforms, fulfilling the role of a general-purpose package manager. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, there are times when even an equivalent set of packages insufficient to guarantee a working environment; existing software installed on the host operating system can sometimes \"bleed\" into the Conda environment, e.g. through environment variables, or additional constraints may be required, such as a particular file-system layout, or port availability. It follows that reproducibility of packages alone is not sufficient to fully reproduce a software environment. Containers are a tool which provide this abstraction by not only \"locking\" the application state (installed packages), but also the filesystem. They support mechanisms for remapping ports, binding external files, and can be deployed as immutable artefacts, avoiding problems of state corruption. For this reason, they can be a powerful tool in distributing the same development environment to a team of software developers. Indeed, tools such as Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA now provide remote development workflows that are powered by containers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The container concept has undergone many iterations and realisations in the last decade, with recent popularity driven by Docker, which has seen vast adoption since its introduction in 2013.{cite:ps}`zhu_if_2018` Since that time, industry-wide efforts have focused upon standardisation, with the Open Container Initiative developing standards for container images (that contain the container filesystem) and container runtimes (that extract the container image and setup the relevant namespaces for execution). JupyterHub supports a number of spawners which work with user-defined container images, including `KubeSpawner` and `DockerSpawner`. The benefit of using containers in this context is predominantly to reduce development time; user containers can be tested locally on a local JupyterHub instance, and subsequently deployed with high confidence to remote / cloud-based Hubs. The ease of local development conserves developer time that would otherwise be spent on administering the remote deployment. At the time of O-Lab development, Docker was still a popular choice of image builder and container runtime, and was used to implement both the reproducible development environment, and the final production user image (see {numref}`olab-dockerfile`).

    "An impediment to deploying a JupyterHub within an academic institution is the lack of appropriate compute resources. Whilst universities often maintain on-prem compute facilities, these are usually designed to tackle conventional (homogeneous) HPC workloads, rather than the heterogeneous demands of general-purpose user containers. Whilst these systems can be leveraged to host a JupyterHub instance, e.g. using the aforementioned SLURM spawner, in practice the limitations of these systems are encountered fairly immediately. On an administrative level, HPC resources are typically earmarked for research purposes; deployment of teaching resources usually requires a separate treatment. Nonetheless, a trial deployment using the SLURM spawner was trialed to evaluate the viability of the HPC platform as a compute layer. There were several notable drawbacks identified during this trial period: users required VPN access in order to access the Hub from outside the University network, and the startup times were considerable; in some instances, on the order of tens of minutes. In general, this is a drawback of HPC-oriented schedulers; users are rewarded for short-running jobs. Meanwhile, JupyterHub jobs are unknown in duration, and therefore we must ask the schedule for long runtimes on the order of many hours, which leads to low job priorities. \n",
    "\n",
    "It follows that a more versatile deployment solution was needed. Without dedicated on-prem compute to power O-Lab, a cloud solution was sought after. In this space, the dominant approach is to use Kubernetes as the lingua-franca of cloud compute providers. Kubernetes defines an abstract set of primitives that collectively facilitate large-scale container orchestration and deployment (see {numref}`kubernetes-diagram`). It is supported by the majority of cloud providers, meaning that an investment in a particular cloud provider is not fraught with the perils of vendor lock-in, as is common with bespoke cloud platforms. \n",

This flexibility was employed during the O-Lab trials; an initial deployment was made onto Microsoft Azure, before subsequent migration to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)."

    "A significant drawback of using cloud infrastructure is the runtime costs. Whilst these services take responsibility for managing the infrastructure upon which they operate, this comes with an associated penalty with respect to usage tariffs; users are typically charged according to the number of nodes (and their respective configurations) required to run the cluster. Cloud operators increasingly offer managed Kubernetes deployments, such as Google Kubernetes Engine's Autopilot, in which the baseline runtime cost is governed by the number of _pods_ running, rather than the nodes upon which they run. In this model, even more of the work associated with deploying an application on Kubernetes is managed by the cloud provider, simplifying the task of deploying an application. In general, the tradeoffs and benefits of using a managed service over a self-managed deployment yield an inflection point in the baseline load below which it is more affordable to manage the deployment one's self. Furthermore, managed Kubernetes services often do not benefit from the same \"free tier\" benefits that providers such as Google Cloud make available. As such, this self-managed scheme was used in the O-Lab. For this reason, infrastructure-as-code was of particular importance; the ability to programmatically tear down and subsequently re-establish the cluster infrastructure enabled the implementation cost-saving shutdowns during quiet period (e.g. weekends)."

In this distribution, JupyterHub employs two primary Kubernetes pods: a proxy pod, and a Hub pod, that together comprise \"JupyterHub\". The proxy is used to route network traffic between different endpoints according to a cookie that is associated with each user request. If a user already exists, the proxy pod routes their traffic to the appropriate user pod. Otherwise, the request is instead sent to he Hub pod, which creates the user container.
