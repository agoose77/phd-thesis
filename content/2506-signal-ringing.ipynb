This phenomenon, known as \"ringing\", presents a challenge to the reconstruction of particle trajectories within the TPC. An example waveform is shown in {numref}`ringing-waveform`."

    "Consequently, the loci of peaks fit to saturated waveforms can be used to define a set of time intervals in which ringing signals may be anticipated. Given that one cannot use the GET fit to perform a robust classification between a measurement and a ringing signal, the amplitude of the signal may be used instead. It is observed that the majority of ringing signals have amplitudes well below that of the saturated signal, on the order of $y \\lt 750$. By taking the logical AND of these two conditions, a better classification of ringing signals can be performed."
