# Abstract

+++

It has long been postulated that light nuclei may exhibit molecular and clustered structures. Clustering in non-alpha conjugate nuclei is of particular interest in demonstrating the role of valence nucleons in stabilising the nucleus. 
One such example is the stability of the Borromean nucleus {math}`{}^{9}\mathrm{Be}` over its alpha-conjugate sibling {math}`{}^{8}\mathrm{Be}` {cite:ps}`von_oertzen_nuclear_2006`.  Given the existing works investigating these structures in {math}`{}^{14}\mathrm{C}`, it is the object of this thesis to explore the symmetries of the mirror nucleus {math}`{}^{14}\mathrm{O}` and investigate the existence of low-lying clustered states, and their respective properties. Novel approaches to track reconstruction in TPCs have been developed, and used to make a preliminary investigation into the spectrum of the {math}`{}^{14}\mathrm{O}` nucleus.

Shortly following its onset in early 2020, a concerted effort in the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Birmingham arose to establish novel solutions for distance learning provision. In particular, the challenge of providing robust, flexible teaching of undergraduate laboratory skills was identified as a key limitation in responding to the exigent challenges posed by public health interventions during 2020 and 2021. To meet this need, a virtual nuclear physics laboratory was developed and deployed to University undergraduate students, and their engagement with this new resource recorded. An exploration of these findings, and future directions of the project, was subsequently made.
