    "In {ref}`content:micromegas`, it was noted that the MicroMeGaS anode is subdivided into a set of distinct zones that can be held at different potentials in order to spatially vary the gain. In this experiment, both the strip-chain (side) regions and final block of pads in the central region were held at a high gain in order to better resolve light particle tracks with low stopping powers (see {numref}`micromegas-anode-gain-region`). \n",

This was experimentally measured by observing the change in charge collected by the rows of pads either side of the high-low gain boundary.\n",
