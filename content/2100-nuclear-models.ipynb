    "The pairing force, which anti-aligns the angular momenta of like-nucleons within the same orbital, is responsible for some of the most exciting phenomena in nuclear physics, e.g. the even-even energy gap between the ground state and lowest single-particle excitation, or the zero angular momentum of even-even ground state nuclei. It is most strikingly seen within the {math}`\\alpha`-particle system, which is comprised to two correlated pairs of protons and neutrons. In combination with the small symmetry energy of the system, the pairing interaction is responsible for the significant binding energy (28 MeV), and first excited state (20 MeV). These two properties suggest that where an {math}`\\alpha`-particle forms in the nucleus, it may remain stable for a considerable period of time.{cite:ps}`freer_clustered_2007-2` Meanwhile, the emission of {math}`\\alpha`-particles from the nucleus implies that such particles might be preformed and exist prior to the decay. Although it is known that such an assumption is overly reductive, the existence of many alpha-clustered structures is postulated by the Ikeda threshold rule, which predicts the emergence of such structures near the alpha breakup threshold.\n",

    "A number of examples of \"clustering\" phenomena, including alpha condensates (e.g. {math}`{}^8\\text{Be}`), can be seen in {numref}`types-of-nuclear-clustering`. In recent times, a focus has been placed on neutron-rich nuclei, where the existence of valence neutrons has been shown to stabilise the cluster structure and give rise to exotic structures known as nuclear molecules. In the case of {math}`{}^8\\text{Be}`; the alpha condensate has a half-life of {math}`\\sim 10^{-16}`s, whereas the isotope {math}`{}^9\\text{Be}` is considered stable. The role of the valence neutron can be shown through a separated harmonic oscillator approach to be that of stabilising the nucleus; the superposition of the neutron wavefunctions in the {math}`p^{\\frac{3}{2}-}`orbital leads to the formation of {math}`\\sigma` and {math}`\\pi` bonds. The term \"nuclear molecule\" is well-chosen; in the case of the beryllium isotopes, the effective {math}`\\alpha`-{math}`\\alpha` potential is weakly attractive, yet at smaller distances becomes strongly repulsive. This hard-core, which naturally follows from Pauli blocking, requires one of the clusters to move into the next major shell. Hence, the weak-attraction strong-repulsion interaction closely resembles the Van Der Waals molecular potential, giving rise to the name \"nuclear molecule\".{cite:ps}`von_oertzen_search_2004`\n",
