    "    > The Hartree-Fock equations show a mechanism by which the nucleons themselves can produce a strong central field in a nucleus in analogy to the central Coulomb field in the atom, which is not produced by the electrons. What makes this possible? Clearly the assumption of the Hartree-Fock approximation was the neglection of correlations, arising from direct particle-particle scattering not mediated by the mean field. This is reasonable if the scattering is prohibited by the Pauli principle, so that an inordinately large amount of energy is needed for the process. The correlations are, however, important for the excited states and this will be the topic in Sect. 8.2.\n",
