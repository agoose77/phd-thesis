What makes this possible? Clearly the assumption of the Hartree-Fock approximation was the neglection of correlations, arising from direct particle-particle scattering not mediated by the mean field. This is reasonable if the scattering is prohibited by the Pauli principle, so that an inordinately large amount of energy is needed for the process. The correlations are, however, important for the excited states and this will be the topic in Sect. 8.2.\n",

    "    > The full two-body interaction to the extent that it is not included in the mean field is called the residual interaction. One important part of it is taken into account by the pairing force (Sect. 7.5) and other contributions lead to correlated excitations as mentioned.\n",
    "    > \n",
    "    > The Hartree-Fock equations form a self-consistent problem in the sense that the wave functions determine the mean field, while the mean field in turn determines the wave functions. In practice this leads to iterative solutions in which one starts\n"
