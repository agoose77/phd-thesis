    "This thesis comprises two superficially distinct branches of academia; the pursuit of new understanding through experimental research, and the development and subsequent exploration of a virtual laboratory and its impact on student engagement. Weaving together these efforts is the remarkable importance of computational narratives, and the foundations upon which they are built; the tools that underpin my research into the substructure of the nucleus are the same tools upon which a digital, remote laboratory experience was developed. \n",

    "The development of ab-initio (beyond-shell-model) theory is fundamentally constrained by both the intractability of the many-body nuclear potential, and the limitations of non-effective potentials. At the frontier of these descriptions is the no-core shell model (NCSM) which treats the problem directly within the (truncated) Hilbert space of the {math}`N` body system. In practice, it has only recently become feasible to attempt such calculations for light nuclei, and such models are typically unable to probe coherent excitations such as the Hoyle state.{cite:ps}`neff_nuclear_2008` It follows that these exists a desideratum for a class of testable and interpretable models of the nucleus that capture the complex correlational and coherent phenomena that escape the classic shell model. These models are of vital importance in contextualising the ongoing research into the structure of light nuclei.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has long been postulated that light nuclei may exhibit molecular and clustered structures. Clustering in non-alpha conjugate nuclei is of particular interest in demonstrating the role of valence nucleons in stabilising the nucleus. One such example is the stability of {math}`{}^{9}\\mathrm{Be}` over its alpha-conjugate sibling {math}`{}^{8}\\mathrm{Be}`. Given the existing works investigating these structures in {math}`{}^{14}C`, it is the object of this work to explore the symmetries of the mirror nucleus {math}`{}^{14}O`.\n",
