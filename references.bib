  abstract = {Calculations of the pair-creation energy {$\epsilon$}, the Fano factor F, and the quantum yield for semiconductors are done for the assumptions that in each scattering event all possible sets of product particles are equally probable, that the energy bands are those of free particles separated by a band gap Eg, and that there is a single phonon energy {$\hslash\omega$}0. A new method of calculating these quantities is advanced. In it a pair-number probability distribution pn(E), the probability that a particle with energy E ultimately creates n pairs, is calculated recursively with increasing E. The first and second moments of the pn(E) distribution yield {$\epsilon$}, F, and the quantum yield as functions of {$\hslash\omega$}0, Eg, and a parameter A, proportional to the ratio of the matrix elements for electron scattering by phonon emission and by ionization. We find that a single value of A, which fits the {$\epsilon$} observed for Si, gives values for these quantities in good accord with experiments for many semiconductors. The calculated {$\epsilon$} is found insensitive in many semiconductors to electron-energy loss to plasmons and to differences in the threshold energy for ionization representing real band-structure features. The assumption that all possible sets of product particles are equally probable in each scattering event leads to ultimate nonuniform population of the states with energies below the threshold for ionization, in contrast to the uniform population assumed in some earlier approaches. Results of other existing approaches in which the final-state distribution is calculated, an alternate method, were duplicated using this new method. A simple paradigm is used to illustrate these methods and assumptions.},

  abstract = {Phys. Rev. C 95, 064318 (2017) The decay properties of the linear-chain states in \textsuperscript{14\$}C are investigated by using the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics. The calculation predicts two rotational bands with linear-chain configurations having the {$\pi$}-bond and {$\sigma$}-bond valence neutrons. For the {$\pi$}-bond linear-chain, the calculated excitation energies and the widths of {$\alpha$}-decay to the ground state of \$\^10\textbackslash rm Be\$ reasonably agree with the experimental candidates observed by the \$\textbackslash alpha+\^10\textbackslash rm Be\$ resonant scattering. On the other hand, the {$\sigma$}-bond linear-chain is the candidate of the higher-lying resonant states reported by the break-up reaction. As the evidence of the {$\sigma$}-bond linear-chain, we discuss its decay pattern. It is found that the {$\sigma$}-bond linear-chain not only decays to the excited band of \$\^10\textbackslash rm Be\$ but also decays to the three-body channel of \$\^6\textbackslash rm He+\textbackslash alpha+\textbackslash alpha\$, and the branching ratio of these decays are comparable. Hence, we suggest that this characteristic decay pattern is a strong signature of the linear-chain formation and a key observable to distinguish two different linear-chains.},

These measurements were used to investigate F-18 and Ti-(44,48,52) respectively. In both experiments the Thick Target Inverse Kinematics technique was used and the analysis focused on the investigation of alpha-clustering. The measurements of He-4(N-14,a) and He-4(N-14,d)O-16 were performed between Ex[F-18] = 5.5 \textendash{} 16 MeV, and evaluated using a full R-matrix analysis up to 9 MeV. From this nine new states in F-18 were extracted and the alpha-cluster structure of F-18 was explored by comparison with nuclear models. The measurements of He-4(Ca-40,a), He-4(Ca-44,a) and He-4(Ca-48,a) were made over the ranges Ex[T-44] = 9 \textendash{} 17 MeV, Ex[Ti-48] = 13.5 \textendash{} 24 MeV and Ex[Ti-52] = 12 \textendash{} 20 MeV. The experimental data were analysed using a novel technique developed in this thesis for the identification of fragmented alpha-clustered states, known as the spectral signature analysis. From this analysis nine such states were identified in Ti-44, in good agreement with previous work. None were identified in Ti-48 and three in Ti-52. The implications of these results for alpha-clustering in the fp-shell are discussed.},

  abstract = {Many tasks in computer vision involve assigning a label (such as disparity) to every pixel. A common constraint is that the labels should vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global minimization of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest discontinuity-preserving case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient approximation algorithms. We present two algorithms based on graph cuts that efficiently find a local minimum with respect to two types of large moves, namely expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can simultaneously change the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In contrast, many standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use small moves where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our expansion algorithm finds a labeling within a known factor of the global minimum, while our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions. Both of these algorithms allow important cases of discontinuity preserving energies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image restoration, stereo and motion. On real data with ground truth, we achieve 98 percent accuracy.},

Thus far it can only minimize energies that involve unary, pairwise, and specialized higher-order terms. Our main contribution is to extend {$\alpha$}-expansion so that it can simultaneously optimize ``label costs'' as well. An energy with label costs can penalize a solution based on the set of labels that appear in it. The simplest special case is to penalize the number of labels in the solution. Our energy is quite general, and we prove optimality bounds for our algorithm. A natural application of label costs is multi-model fitting, and we demonstrate several such applications in vision: homography detection, motion segmentation, and unsupervised image segmentation. Our C++/MATLAB implementation is publicly available.},

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

For example, intrinsic broadening occurs in x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements of heavy elements where the core-hole lifetime is very short. On the other hand, nonresonant x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) and other energy loss measurements are more limited by instrumental resolution. Here, we demonstrate that the Richardson-Lucy (RL) iterative algorithm provides a robust method for deconvolving instrumental and intrinsic resolutions from typical XAS and XRS data. For the K-edge XAS of Ag, we find nearly complete removal of \textasciitilde 9.3 eV FWHM broadening from the combined effects of the short core-hole lifetime and instrumental resolution. We are also able to remove nearly all instrumental broadening in an XRS measurement of diamond, with the resulting improved spectrum comparing favorably with prior soft x-ray XAS measurements. We present a practical methodology for implementing the RL algorithm to these problems, emphasizing the importance of testing for stability of the deconvolution process against noise amplification, perturbations in the initial spectra, and uncertainties in the core-hole lifetime.},

Most existing methods, including generalizations of RANSAC, greedily search for models with most inliers (within a threshold) ignoring overall classification of points. We formulate geometric multi-model fitting as an optimal labeling problem with a global energy function balancing geometric errors and regularity of inlier clusters. Regularization based on spatial coherence (on some near-neighbor graph) and/or label costs is NP hard. Standard combinatorial algorithms with guaranteed approximation bounds (e.g. {$\alpha$}-expansion) can minimize such regularization energies over a finite set of labels, but they are not directly applicable to a continuum of labels, e.g. \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\}\^\{2\}\$in line fitting. Our proposed approach (PEaRL) combines model sampling from data points as in RANSAC with iterative re-estimation of inliers and models' parameters based on a global regularization functional. This technique efficiently explores the continuum of labels in the context of energy minimization. In practice, PEaRL converges to a good quality local minimum of the energy automatically selecting a small number of models that best explain the whole data set. Our tests demonstrate that our energy-based approach significantly improves the current state of the art in geometric model fitting currently dominated by various greedy generalizations of RANSAC.},

When it is used for finding lines in a 3D-space, an appropriate line representation and quantisation of the parameter space is necessary. In this paper, we address the problem that a straightforward quantisation of the optimal four-parameter representation of a line after Roberts results in an inhomogeneous tessellation of the geometric space that introduces bias with respect to certain line orientations. We present a discretisation of the line directions via tessellation of an icosahedron that overcomes this problem whenever one parameter in the Hough space represents a direction in 3D (e.g. for lines or planes). The new method is applied to the detection of ridges and straight edges in laser scan data of buildings, where it performs better than a straightforward quantisation.}

The detector consists of a \$2.5 m\textbackslash times 2.3 m\textbackslash times 10.4 m\$ TPC including an array of 32 PMTs used for triggering and timing purposes. The TPC is housed in an evacuable and foam insulated cryostat vessel. It has a 2.5 m drift length in a uniform field up to 500 V/cm. There are 3 readout wire planes (U, V and Y co-ordinates) with a 3-mm wire pitch for a total of 8,256 signal channels. The fiducial mass of the detector is 60 metric tons of LAr. In a LArTPC, ionization electrons from a charged particle track drift along the electric field lines to the detection wire planes inducing bipolar signals on the U and V (induction) planes, and a unipolar signal collected on the (collection) Y plane. The raw wire signals are processed by specialized low-noise front-end readout electronics immersed in LAr which shape and amplify the signal. Further signal processing and digitization is carried out by warm electronics. We present the techniques by which the observed final digitized waveforms, which comprise the original ionization signal convoluted with detector field response and electronics response as well as noise, are processed to recover the original ionization signal in charge and time. The correct modeling of these ingredients is critical for further event reconstruction in LArTPCs.},

The relations between the structure change into the molecule-like structure and the threshold energy for the decay into the subunit nuclei are discussed.

  abstract = {In the last few years, several new algorithms based on graph cuts have been developed to solve energy minimization problems in computer vision. Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph. A software implementation is freely available.},

The heuristic approach outlined in this paper appears to offer significant advantages in the solution of this class of problems in that it (1) provides considerable flexibility in the specification (modeling) of the problem to be solved, (2) can be used to study large-scale problems, that is, complexes with several hundred potential warehouse sites and several thousand shipment destinations, and (3) is economical of computer time. The results obtained in applying the program to small scale problems have been equal to or better than those provided by the alternative methods considered.},

This reproduction of the NN data is more accurate than by any phase-shift analysis and any other NN potential. The charge-dependence of the present potential (that has been dubbed `CD-Bonn') is based upon the predictions by the Bonn Full Model for charge-symmetry and charge-independence breaking in all partial waves with J {$<$}= 4. The potential is represented in terms of the covariant Feynman amplitudes for one-boson exchange which are nonlocal. Therefore, the off-shell behavior of the CD-Bonn potential differs in a characteristic and well-founded way from commonly used local potentials and leads to larger binding energies in nuclear few- and many-body systems, where underbinding is a persistent problem.},

  year = {2016},

  abstract = {The ATLAS, an abbreviation for A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS, detector is one of the two general purpose high luminosity experiments (along with CMS) that have been built for probing p-p and Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions in the LHC. The muon spectrometer encircles the rest of the ATLAS detector subsystems defining the ATLAS overall dimensions. Its principle of operation is based on the magnetic deflection of muon tracks by a system of superconducting air-core toroid magnets providing high resolution muon momentum measurement. The upgrade of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is primarily motivated by the high background radiation expected during Run-3 (2021) and ultimately at \$\textbackslash mathcalL=7\textbackslash times 10\^34\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmcm\^-2s\^-1\$ in HL-LHC (2026). Owing to this the detectors that occupy the innermost muon station called Small Wheel (SW), MDT, CSC \& TGC, will go beyond their design luminosity limit. In addition, the muon trigger rate will exceed the available bandwidth because of the fake endcap muon triggers (\$90\%\$ is coming from low energy particles, generated in the material located between the Small Wheel and the outer endcap muon station). The collaboration has decided to replace the SW with a NSW system combining sTGC \& resistive MM detectors in order to maintain the excellent performance of the muon system beyond Run-2. Both detector technologies should provide tracking and triggering information for redundancy. The NSW will contribute to the suppression of fake triggers by reconstructing high quality \$\textbackslash left(\textbackslash sigma\_\th eta\textbackslash sim 1\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmmrad\textbackslash right)\$ IP pointing segments online. Moreover, efficient \& precise offline tracking (\$\textbackslash sigma\_r\textbackslash leq100\textbackslash,\textbackslash mu\textbackslash mathrmm\$) even for the maximum expected rate of \$15\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmkHz/cm\^2\$ is required. The NSW requires fully efficient high-rate capable MM chambers with a single plane spatial resolution better than \$100\textbackslash,\textbackslash mu\textbackslash mathrmm\$ independent of the track incidence angle and the magnetic field (\$B \textbackslash leq 0.3\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmT\$). Along with the precise tracking the MM should be able to provide a trigger signal, complementary to the sTGC, thus a decent timing resolution is required. In order to demonstrate and prove that the MM satisfy the NSW requirements several tests have been performed on small (\$10\textbackslash times10\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmcm\^2\$) resistive-strip MM chambers using medium (\$10\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmGeV/c\$) and high (\$150\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmGeV/c\$) momentum hadron beams at CERN and electron beam at DESY. The studies presented focus on the efficiency as well as hit and time reconstruction accuracy measured during these tests demonstrating the excellent characteristics of the MM. Exploiting the ability of the MM to work as a Time Projection Chamber a novel method, called the {$\mu$}TPC, has been developed for the case of inclined tracks, allowing for a precise segment reconstruction using a single detection plane. A detailed description of the method along with thorough studies towards refining the method's performance are shown. Moreover, owing to the moderate magnetic field expected in the NSW region (\$0.3\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmT\$), dedicated studies have been devoted in understanding the effect of the Lorentz force on the MM performance when operated inside a magnetic field. The effect of the field has been well understood using test beams, with chambers operated inside magnets, and in simulation. Owing to the quantitative agreement between simulation and test beam measurements the exact knowledge of the magnetic field value has become a prerequisite for a precise track reconstruction in the NSW Micromegas in order to correct for the field effect. Complementary to this, novel methods, for measuring the magnetic field using MM data, have been developed. Complementary to studying and optimising the MM performance, the use of readout geometries with different characteristics had been studied. The adoption of these schemes for the MM readout minimise the number of detection layers and electronic channels, decreasing the complexity, and make the application of Micromegas in large scale experiments feasible. The use of a stereo readout scheme, as foreseen for the NSW MM, allows for a two-dimensional hit position reconstruction with a decent accuracy. The validation of the stereo principle has been performed studying a medium size quadruplet prototype MM, following the NSW stereo readout scheme. Moreover, the possibility of multiplexing MM strips into a smaller number of electronic channels has been studied. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the multiplexing concept, proving that the excellent intrinsic characteristics of the detector remain unaffected by the multiplexing that significantly reduces the number of electronics channels.In parallel to the R\&D on the MM detector several contributions have been made in expanding and improving the efficiency and functionality of the ATLAS Muon Detector Control System (DCS). The two major developments that were realised concern the implementation of a calibration tool for the current offset of MDT high voltage channels using ATLAS luminosity data and a complete and independent DCS for the monitoring of the muon end-cap alignment system. Both developments are integrated into the ATLAS DCS and are used on the regular operation of the ATLAS detector. The initial idea of the current calibration tool, that uses the luminosity data, has been expanded towards developing a technique that can calculate the ATLAS luminosity using the MDT high voltage current data.},

The Fano factor F calculated in an uncorrelated final-state "shot-glass" model does not give an accurate answer even with the exact gap-distribution statistics. Allowing for the nearest-neighbor correlation effects gives a correction to F that brings F very close to its exact value. We discuss the implications of our results for energy resolution of semiconductor gamma detectors, where the value of F is of the essence. We argue that F is controlled by correlations in the cascade energy branching process and hence the widely used final-state model estimates are not reliable -- especially in the practically relevant cases when the energy branching is terminated by competition between impact ionization and phonon emission.},

  abstract = {An experimental technique for studying elastic scattering using a thick gas target is described, with a measurement of the alpha]( super(24)Ne,alpha]) reaction used as an example. Advantages such as ease, detector efficiency, and the possibility of measuring the cross section at 180degrees] in the centre-of-mass are discussed. It is shown that a resolution of tens of keV is practical at zero degrees, and that the dominant contribution to the resolution for large angles is angular straggling of the beam in the entrance window. The use of helium gas as the target allows direct measurement of alpha]-cluster states.},

  abstract = {It is a well-known fact that a cluster of nucleons can be formed in the interior of an atomic nucleus, and such clusters may occupy molecular-like orbitals, showing characteristics similar to normal molecules consisting of atoms. Chemical molecules having a linear alignment are commonly seen in nature, such as carbon dioxide. A similar linear alignment of the nuclear clusters, referred to as linear-chain cluster state (LCCS), has been studied since the 1950s, however, up to now there is no clear experimental evidence demonstrating the existence of such a state. Recently, it was proposed that an excess of neutrons may offer just such a stabilizing mechanism, revitalizing interest in the nuclear LCCS, specifically with predictions for their emergence in neutron-rich carbon isotopes. Here we present the experimental observation of -cluster states in the radioactive C nucleus. Using the resonant scattering method with a radioactive beam, we observed a series of levels which completely agree with theoretically predicted levels having an explicit linear-chain cluster configuration. We regard this as the first strong indication of the linear-chain clustered nucleus.},
