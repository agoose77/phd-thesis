It also aims to determine the views of students' on virtual laboratory. The study involved 42 students who was divided into two groups (21 experimental, 21 control). Students were randomly assigned to both groups. In the research, the pre-test and post-test control group design was used. The experimental group used the virtual laboratory. On the other hand the control group used physical laboratory. The research data were obtained via the ``physics laboratory attitude scale'' and semi-structured interviews. The result of this study carried out that virtual laboratory experiences made positive effects on students' attitudes. In addition, semi-structured interviews were found out that they had positive opinions regarding the virtual physics laboratory experiences.},

  abstract = {A new nuclear model is proposed that describes the cluster and the shell structures unifiedly. By the present model one can investigate characteristics of one-particle orbitals in clustering states and also polarizations of constituent clusters. The model has its base on the Hartree-Fock (H. F.) approximation for nuclear intrinsic states. The basis wave functions used in the present H. F. calculations are constructed from single-particle wave functions around each ``cluster center'', which can well describe possible large eccentric nuclear deformations in light nuclei. The model is analogous to the LCAO-MO-SCF method in the molecular physics. Numerical calculations are performed using an effective two-nucleon force (Volkov No. 1) for the ground states of 8Be and 12C nuclei, and interesting results are obtained about the stability of {$\alpha$}-cluster structures. Polarizations are smallest at the equilibrium distance between {$\alpha$}-clusters, determined by Brink's {$\alpha$}-particle model. An artifical collapse or an extreme decomposition of the {$\alpha$}-cluster structures brings about large polarizations. By those polarizations of constituent {$\alpha$}-clusters themselves, the {$\alpha$}-cluster structure recovers their density distributions. Comparisons of the results are made with those of two-center shell model, usual H. F. calculation and {$\alpha$}-particle model.},

This theory keeps track of the correlations and therefore allows for a selfconsistent theoretical description of the entire complex dynamics of heavy ion collisions, from the initial non-equilibrium penetration stage via the high density phase to the final formation of complex \textemdash{} stable and unstable \textemdash{} fragments. The cluster formation is caused by correlations and density fluctuations. We find that global equilibrium is not established in the course of the reaction. The form of the mass yield curve agrees with experimental findings. We also study the recently observed collective flow effects and find a strong dependence on the nuclear equation of state.},

A new method of calculating these quantities is advanced. In it a pair-number probability distribution pn(E), the probability that a particle with energy E ultimately creates n pairs, is calculated recursively with increasing E. The first and second moments of the pn(E) distribution yield {$\epsilon$}, F, and the quantum yield as functions of {$\hslash\omega$}0, Eg, and a parameter A, proportional to the ratio of the matrix elements for electron scattering by phonon emission and by ionization. We find that a single value of A, which fits the {$\epsilon$} observed for Si, gives values for these quantities in good accord with experiments for many semiconductors. The calculated {$\epsilon$} is found insensitive in many semiconductors to electron-energy loss to plasmons and to differences in the threshold energy for ionization representing real band-structure features. The assumption that all possible sets of product particles are equally probable in each scattering event leads to ultimate nonuniform population of the states with energies below the threshold for ionization, in contrast to the uniform population assumed in some earlier approaches. Results of other existing approaches in which the final-state distribution is calculated, an alternate method, were duplicated using this new method. A simple paradigm is used to illustrate these methods and assumptions.},

On the other hand, in the negative-parity states, it is found that the linear-chain configuration does not correspond to a single eigenstate but is mixed with other configurations in the eigenstates and does not form a single rotational band. As a further evidence of the linear-chain formation, we focus on the {$\alpha$}-decay pattern. It is shown that the linear-chain states decay to the excited states of daughter nucleus 10Be as well as to the ground state, while other cluster states dominantly decay into the ground state.

These measurements were used to investigate F-18 and Ti-(44,48,52) respectively. In both experiments the Thick Target Inverse Kinematics technique was used and the analysis focused on the investigation of alpha-clustering. The measurements of He-4(N-14,a) and He-4(N-14,d)O-16 were performed between Ex[F-18] = 5.5 \textendash{} 16 MeV, and evaluated using a full R-matrix analysis up to 9 MeV. From this nine new states in F-18 were extracted and the alpha-cluster structure of F-18 was explored by comparison with nuclear models. The measurements of He-4(Ca-40,a), He-4(Ca-44,a) and He-4(Ca-48,a) were made over the ranges Ex[T-44] = 9 \textendash{} 17 MeV, Ex[Ti-48] = 13.5 \textendash{} 24 MeV and Ex[Ti-52] = 12 \textendash{} 20 MeV. The experimental data were analysed using a novel technique developed in this thesis for the identification of fragmented alpha-clustered states, known as the spectral signature analysis. From this analysis nine such states were identified in Ti-44, in good agreement with previous work. None were identified in Ti-48 and three in Ti-52. The implications of these results for alpha-clustering in the fp-shell are discussed.},

We present the complete ab initio NCSM formalism and review highlights obtained with it since its inception. These highlights include the first ab initio nuclear-structure calculations utilizing chiral NNN interactions, which predict the correct low-lying spectrum for 10B and explain the anomalous long 14C {$\beta$}-decay lifetime. We also obtain the small quadrupole moment of 6Li. In addition to explaining long-standing nuclear structure anomalies, the ab initio NCSM provides a predictive framework for observables that are not yet measured or are not directly measurable. For example, reactions between short-lived systems and reaction rates near zero energy are relevant to fusion research but may not be known from experiment with sufficient precision. We, therefore, discuss, in detail, the extension of the ab initio NCSM to nuclear reactions and sketch a number of promising future directions for research emerging from the NCSM foundation, including a microscopic non-perturbative framework for the theory with a core. Having a parameter-free approach, we can construct systems with a core, which will provide an ab initio pathway to heavier nuclei.},

Learning from our students' experience during this period will help us shape future hybrid delivery so that it best fits Bioscience students. This pedagogical study explored Aston University's Bioscience students' experiences of studying from home, and the impact of the lockdown on mental wellbeing and quality of life. 151 students completed an online survey during August 2020, which included open and closed questions. Analysis of survey data revealed that a majority of students reported positive experiences of online open-book assessments and most would welcome this format in the future. The majority of students faced no technical issues, predominantly stating that they also had good internet connectivity. Shifting to remote learning and online classrooms uncovered conflicting preferences; despite wanting more interactive lectures, only half of the students were comfortable interacting using video cameras. Free text responses provided an insight into how some students reported an inadequate home working space/environment and lacked necessary items such as a desk, highlighting how remote working may intensify social and digital inequality - particularly for students from more deprived households. Wider detrimental experiences of lockdown included dissatisfaction with access to healthcare, decreased concentration, sleeping difficulties and a decline in mental wellbeing. Education strategies going forward will need to address the mental health needs of students who have suffered during the pandemic. Our university, amongst others, is embracing hybrid course delivery, which could offer a solution to ensuring Bioscience students receive hands-on laboratory experience and face-to-face contact to remain motivated and benefit from the on-campus facilities and support, whilst allowing students some of the flexibility afforded by remote study. In the current competitive higher education market where student retention is key, it is important to consider student demographics and digital equity to ensure an appropriate approach is applied to cater for all students.},

  abstract = {AMONG the properties of atomic nuclei disclosed by the fundamental researches of Lord Rutherford and his followers on artificial nuclear transmutations, one of the most striking is the extraordinary tendency of such nuclei to react with each other as soon as direct contact is established. In fact, almost any type of nuclear reactions consistent with energy conservation seems likely to occur in close nuclear collisions. In collisions between charged particles and nuclei, contact is, of course, often prevented or made less probable by the mutual electric repulsion; and the typical features of nuclear reactions are therefore perhaps most clearly shown by neutron impacts. Already in his original work on the properties of high-speed neutrons Chadwick recognised their great effectiveness in producing nuclear transmutations1. Especially after the discovery of artificial radioactivity by Mme and M. Joliot-Curie, most instructive evidence regarding nuclear reactions has been obtained through the researches of Fermi and his collaborators on radioactivity produced by bombardment with high-speed neutrons as well as with neutrons of thermal velocities2.},

  abstract = {Many tasks in computer vision involve assigning a label (such as disparity) to every pixel. A common constraint is that the labels should vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global minimization of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest discontinuity-preserving case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient approximation algorithms. We present two algorithms based on graph cuts that efficiently find a local minimum with respect to two types of large moves, namely expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can simultaneously change the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In contrast, many standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use small moves where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our expansion algorithm finds a labeling within a known factor of the global minimum, while our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions. Both of these algorithms allow important cases of discontinuity preserving energies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image restoration, stereo and motion. On real data with ground truth, we achieve 98 percent accuracy.},

The nuclear wave function has both strong short-range correlations and long-range contributions. Natural orbitals provide a means of adapting the single-particle basis for ab initio no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) calculations to better match the many-body wave function. Natural orbitals are obtained by diagonalizing the one-body density matrix from a calculation using an initial single-particle reference basis, such as the traditional harmonic oscillator basis. The natural orbital basis builds in contributions from high-lying oscillator shells, thus accelerating convergence of wave functions, energies, and other observables. The convergence of the ground and excited state energies, radii, and electromagnetic observables of He, Li, and Be isotopes calculated using natural orbitals in ab initio NCCI calculations is discussed. It is found that electromagnetic observables involving the M1 operator fully converge, while the calculated energies, radii, and observables involving the E2 operator converge significantly faster with the natural orbital basis than with the harmonic oscillator basis. The use of infrared (IR) extrapolation schemes with the natural orbital calculations is also explored.},

Thus far it can only minimize energies that involve unary, pairwise, and specialized higher-order terms. Our main contribution is to extend {$\alpha$}-expansion so that it can simultaneously optimize ``label costs'' as well. An energy with label costs can penalize a solution based on the set of labels that appear in it. The simplest special case is to penalize the number of labels in the solution. Our energy is quite general, and we prove optimality bounds for our algorithm. A natural application of label costs is multi-model fitting, and we demonstrate several such applications in vision: homography detection, motion segmentation, and unsupervised image segmentation. Our C++/MATLAB implementation is publicly available.},

A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

For example, intrinsic broadening occurs in x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements of heavy elements where the core-hole lifetime is very short. On the other hand, nonresonant x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) and other energy loss measurements are more limited by instrumental resolution. Here, we demonstrate that the Richardson-Lucy (RL) iterative algorithm provides a robust method for deconvolving instrumental and intrinsic resolutions from typical XAS and XRS data. For the K-edge XAS of Ag, we find nearly complete removal of \textasciitilde 9.3 eV FWHM broadening from the combined effects of the short core-hole lifetime and instrumental resolution. We are also able to remove nearly all instrumental broadening in an XRS measurement of diamond, with the resulting improved spectrum comparing favorably with prior soft x-ray XAS measurements. We present a practical methodology for implementing the RL algorithm to these problems, emphasizing the importance of testing for stability of the deconvolution process against noise amplification, perturbations in the initial spectra, and uncertainties in the core-hole lifetime.},

The goal of this paper is to propose first analysis procedures to be applied on raw data samples from the GET system, in order to correct for systematic effects observed on test measurements. We also present a method to estimate the response function of the GET system channels. The response function is required in analysis where the input signal needs to be reconstructed, in terms of time distribution, from the registered output samples.},

Various guidelines have emerged for achieving reproducibility, but implementation of these practices remains difficult due to the challenge of assembling software tools plus associated libraries, connecting tools together into pipelines, and specifying parameters. Here, we discuss a suite of cutting-edge technologies that make computational reproducibility not just possible, but practical in both time and effort. This suite combines three well-tested components\textemdash a system for building highly portable packages of bioinformatics software, containerization and virtualization technologies for isolating reusable execution environments for these packages, and workflow systems that automatically orchestrate the composition of these packages for entire pipelines\textemdash to achieve an unprecedented level of computational reproducibility. We also provide a practical implementation and five recommendations to help set a typical researcher on the path to performing data analyses reproducibly.},

It was intended to provide 3D information for tracking and momentum measurement together with particle identification by multiple ionization sampling, in a compact detector. This powerful combination soon found applications in other fields: at one extreme, for studies of rare events of simple structure; at the other, for heavy ion collisions, handling ever higher particle densities, finally up to several thousand tracks in a single event, still providing information on a track-to-track basis. Basic physics, performance and limitations of drift chambers in general will be discussed first. Then the characteristics of TPCs will be introduced, as well as their practical realization and performance. The development from the first TPC, 30 years ago, to the present day will be covered and followed by a few final comments on the ongoing studies for future applications.},

It is because of the flexible nature of the AMD wave function which can describe the formation and dissolution of clusters both in collision problems and in structure problems. After brief explanation of successful applications of AMD to heavy ion collisions and that of the frictional cooling technique for constructing minimum-energy wave functions, the results of the AMD analyses of Li, Be, and B isotopes are discussed. Very good reproduction of magnetic moments is obtained and is explained to be related with the structure-change between cluster structure and shell-model-like structure within each isotope. The superposition of AMD determinants is shown to reproduce neutron halo structure.},

  abstract = {Geometric model fitting is a typical chicken-\&-egg problem: data points should be clustered based on geometric proximity to models whose unknown parameters must be estimated at the same time. Most existing methods, including generalizations of RANSAC, greedily search for models with most inliers (within a threshold) ignoring overall classification of points. We formulate geometric multi-model fitting as an optimal labeling problem with a global energy function balancing geometric errors and regularity of inlier clusters. Regularization based on spatial coherence (on some near-neighbor graph) and/or label costs is NP hard. Standard combinatorial algorithms with guaranteed approximation bounds (e.g. {$\alpha$}-expansion) can minimize such regularization energies over a finite set of labels, but they are not directly applicable to a continuum of labels, e.g. \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\}\^\{2\}\$in line fitting. Our proposed approach (PEaRL) combines model sampling from data points as in RANSAC with iterative re-estimation of inliers and models' parameters based on a global regularization functional. This technique efficiently explores the continuum of labels in the context of energy minimization. In practice, PEaRL converges to a good quality local minimum of the energy automatically selecting a small number of models that best explain the whole data set. Our tests demonstrate that our energy-based approach significantly improves the current state of the art in geometric model fitting currently dominated by various greedy generalizations of RANSAC.},

The most celebrated symmetry of this kind is SU(3), which is the basis of Elliott's model of rotation. It corresponds to a deformed mean field induced by a quadrupole interaction in a single major oscillator shell N and can be generalized to include several major shells. As such, Elliott's SU(3) model establishes the link between the spherical shell model and the (quadrupole component of the) geometric collective model. We introduce the analogue symmetry induced by an octupole interaction in two major oscillator shells and N, leading to an octupole-deformed solution of the spherical shell model. We show that in the limit of large oscillator shells, , the algebraic octupole interaction tends to that of the geometric collective model.},

In this paper, we apply the N{$\alpha$}-cluster model so as to clarify what is the most essential problem in the description of 12C and 16O by using a very large functional space and various effective interactions. This procedure is carried out by combining frameworks of the constraint cooling method introduced in Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics (AMD) and generator coordinate method (GCM). The resultant energy levels of 16O show that various effective interactions give the second 0+ state of 16O just around the 12C + {$\alpha$} threshold energy. This result agrees with the picture of the Ikeda diagram. However, even if we use some density dependent interactions, the binding energy difference between 12C and 16O cannot be remarkably improved.},

  abstract = {Fundamentals of Nuclear Physics is a textbook on nuclear physics aimed at undergraduates in their final year, designed to give the student a thorough understanding of the principal features of nuclei, nuclear decays and nuclear reactions. The book covers the elementary concepts of the subject necessary for introductory courses and also explores more advanced topics, suitable for graduate courses. Initially several models are described and used to explain nuclear properties with many illustrative examples. Sections follow on a-, B- and y-decay, fission, thermonuclear fusion, reactions, nuclear forces and nuclear collective motion. In each case many examples are discussed, and the student should gain a thorough grounding in knowledge of the nucleus. The presentation is quantitative and short derivations are given in full to enable the student to make predictions about nuclear phenomena. This book will be of value to all undergraduates studying nuclear physics, as well as to first-year graduates. The level of the presentation bridges the gap between introductory undergraduate and the more advanced graduate textbooks.},

When it is used for finding lines in a 3D-space, an appropriate line representation and quantisation of the parameter space is necessary. In this paper, we address the problem that a straightforward quantisation of the optimal four-parameter representation of a line after Roberts results in an inhomogeneous tessellation of the geometric space that introduces bias with respect to certain line orientations. We present a discretisation of the line directions via tessellation of an icosahedron that overcomes this problem whenever one parameter in the Hough space represents a direction in 3D (e.g. for lines or planes). The new method is applied to the detection of ridges and straight edges in laser scan data of buildings, where it performs better than a straightforward quantisation.}

  abstract = {The MicroBooNE experiment is designed to observe interactions of neutrinos with a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector from the on-axis Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) and off-axis Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The detector consists of a \$2.5 m\textbackslash times 2.3 m\textbackslash times 10.4 m\$ TPC including an array of 32 PMTs used for triggering and timing purposes. The TPC is housed in an evacuable and foam insulated cryostat vessel. It has a 2.5 m drift length in a uniform field up to 500 V/cm. There are 3 readout wire planes (U, V and Y co-ordinates) with a 3-mm wire pitch for a total of 8,256 signal channels. The fiducial mass of the detector is 60 metric tons of LAr. In a LArTPC, ionization electrons from a charged particle track drift along the electric field lines to the detection wire planes inducing bipolar signals on the U and V (induction) planes, and a unipolar signal collected on the (collection) Y plane. The raw wire signals are processed by specialized low-noise front-end readout electronics immersed in LAr which shape and amplify the signal. Further signal processing and digitization is carried out by warm electronics. We present the techniques by which the observed final digitized waveforms, which comprise the original ionization signal convoluted with detector field response and electronics response as well as noise, are processed to recover the original ionization signal in charge and time. The correct modeling of these ingredients is critical for further event reconstruction in LArTPCs.},

First the formulation of AMD including various refined versions is briefly presented and its characteristics are discussed, putting a stress on its nature as an ab initio theory. Then we demonstrate fruitful applications to various structure problems in stable nuclei, in order to explicitly verify the ab initio nature of AMD, especially the ability to describe both mean-field-type structure and cluster structure. Finally, we show the results of applications of AMD to unstable nuclei, from which we see that AMD is powerful in elucidating and understanding various types of nuclear structure of unstable nuclei.

Angular momentum projection is applied to these intrinsic states in order to obtain the eigenstates of angular momentum. It is shown that the clustering structure appears in the nuclei in the N{$\approxeq$}Z region with N and Z standing for the neutron and proton numbers, respectively. The clustering structure changes toward the shell-model-like structure as N increases to around N{$\approxeq$}8. Furthermore appearance of new-type clustering features is suggested in the neutron-richer region with N{$>$}8. Energy spectra and other quantities are shown to be reproduced well. Especially the calculated magnetic moments describe the observed data quite well, and the neutron number dependence of the observed magnetic moments is explained as the reflection of the structure change of the isotopes from the clustering structure to the shell-model-like structure. It is indicated that the density dependence of the effective interaction is important.},

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the education system worldwide, which was forced to respond with a sudden shift to distance learning. While successful distance teaching requires careful thinking, planning, and the development of technological and human resources, there was no time for preparation in the current situation. Various physics courses, including lectures, tutorials, and laboratory courses, had to be transferred to online formats, resulting in a variety of simultaneous, asynchronous, and mixed activities. To investigate how physics students perceived the sudden shift to online learning, we developed a questionnaire and gathered data from N=578 physics students from five universities in Germany, Austria, and Croatia. In this article, we report how the problem-solving sessions (recitations) and laboratories were adapted, how students judge the different formats of the courses, and how useful and effective they perceived them. The results are correlated with the students' self-efficacy ratings and other behavioral measures (such as self-regulated learning skills). This study is descriptive in nature, and a survey study design was implemented to examine the relationships among the variables. We found that good communication abilities (r=0.48, p{$<$}0.001) and self-organization skills (r=0.63, p{$<$}0.001) are positively correlated with perceived learning achievement. Furthermore, the previous duration of studies had a significant impact on several self-reported achievement measures, resulting in consistently lower scores of students in their first academic year compared with students who were further along academically. We draw conclusions and suggest implications for future online classes on the instructor and faculty level. Suggestions include (i) focusing on first-year courses with on-campus teaching when facing limited lecture hall capacities, (ii) offering special courses for promoting self-regulated learning skills, (iii) emphasizing the positive aspects of distance learning, and (iv) installing networking services for supporting student communication.},

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph.

This paper outlines a heuristic computer program for locating warehouses and compares it with recently published efforts at solving the problem either by means of simulation or as a variant of linear programing. The heuristic approach outlined in this paper appears to offer significant advantages in the solution of this class of problems in that it (1) provides considerable flexibility in the specification (modeling) of the problem to be solved, (2) can be used to study large-scale problems, that is, complexes with several hundred potential warehouse sites and several thousand shipment destinations, and (3) is economical of computer time. The results obtained in applying the program to small scale problems have been equal to or better than those provided by the alternative methods considered.},

This reproduction of the NN data is more accurate than by any phase-shift analysis and any other NN potential. The charge-dependence of the present potential (that has been dubbed `CD-Bonn') is based upon the predictions by the Bonn Full Model for charge-symmetry and charge-independence breaking in all partial waves with J {$<$}= 4. The potential is represented in terms of the covariant Feynman amplitudes for one-boson exchange which are nonlocal. Therefore, the off-shell behavior of the CD-Bonn potential differs in a characteristic and well-founded way from commonly used local potentials and leads to larger binding energies in nuclear few- and many-body systems, where underbinding is a persistent problem.},

  year = {2016},
  month = apr,
  abstract = {The ATLAS, an abbreviation for A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS, detector is one of the two general purpose high luminosity experiments (along with CMS) that have been built for probing p-p and Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions in the LHC. The muon spectrometer encircles the rest of the ATLAS detector subsystems defining the ATLAS overall dimensions. Its principle of operation is based on the magnetic deflection of muon tracks by a system of superconducting air-core toroid magnets providing high resolution muon momentum measurement. The upgrade of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is primarily motivated by the high background radiation expected during Run-3 (2021) and ultimately at \$\textbackslash mathcalL=7\textbackslash times 10\^34\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmcm\^-2s\^-1\$ in HL-LHC (2026). Owing to this the detectors that occupy the innermost muon station called Small Wheel (SW), MDT, CSC \& TGC, will go beyond their design luminosity limit. In addition, the muon trigger rate will exceed the available bandwidth because of the fake endcap muon triggers (\$90\%\$ is coming from low energy particles, generated in the material located between the Small Wheel and the outer endcap muon station). The collaboration has decided to replace the SW with a NSW system combining sTGC \& resistive MM detectors in order to maintain the excellent performance of the muon system beyond Run-2. Both detector technologies should provide tracking and triggering information for redundancy. The NSW will contribute to the suppression of fake triggers by reconstructing high quality \$\textbackslash left(\textbackslash sigma\_\th eta\textbackslash sim 1\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmmrad\textbackslash right)\$ IP pointing segments online. Moreover, efficient \& precise offline tracking (\$\textbackslash sigma\_r\textbackslash leq100\textbackslash,\textbackslash mu\textbackslash mathrmm\$) even for the maximum expected rate of \$15\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmkHz/cm\^2\$ is required. The NSW requires fully efficient high-rate capable MM chambers with a single plane spatial resolution better than \$100\textbackslash,\textbackslash mu\textbackslash mathrmm\$ independent of the track incidence angle and the magnetic field (\$B \textbackslash leq 0.3\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmT\$). Along with the precise tracking the MM should be able to provide a trigger signal, complementary to the sTGC, thus a decent timing resolution is required. In order to demonstrate and prove that the MM satisfy the NSW requirements several tests have been performed on small (\$10\textbackslash times10\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmcm\^2\$) resistive-strip MM chambers using medium (\$10\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmGeV/c\$) and high (\$150\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmGeV/c\$) momentum hadron beams at CERN and electron beam at DESY. The studies presented focus on the efficiency as well as hit and time reconstruction accuracy measured during these tests demonstrating the excellent characteristics of the MM. Exploiting the ability of the MM to work as a Time Projection Chamber a novel method, called the {$\mu$}TPC, has been developed for the case of inclined tracks, allowing for a precise segment reconstruction using a single detection plane. A detailed description of the method along with thorough studies towards refining the method's performance are shown. Moreover, owing to the moderate magnetic field expected in the NSW region (\$0.3\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmT\$), dedicated studies have been devoted in understanding the effect of the Lorentz force on the MM performance when operated inside a magnetic field. The effect of the field has been well understood using test beams, with chambers operated inside magnets, and in simulation. Owing to the quantitative agreement between simulation and test beam measurements the exact knowledge of the magnetic field value has become a prerequisite for a precise track reconstruction in the NSW Micromegas in order to correct for the field effect. Complementary to this, novel methods, for measuring the magnetic field using MM data, have been developed. Complementary to studying and optimising the MM performance, the use of readout geometries with different characteristics had been studied. The adoption of these schemes for the MM readout minimise the number of detection layers and electronic channels, decreasing the complexity, and make the application of Micromegas in large scale experiments feasible. The use of a stereo readout scheme, as foreseen for the NSW MM, allows for a two-dimensional hit position reconstruction with a decent accuracy. The validation of the stereo principle has been performed studying a medium size quadruplet prototype MM, following the NSW stereo readout scheme. Moreover, the possibility of multiplexing MM strips into a smaller number of electronic channels has been studied. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the multiplexing concept, proving that the excellent intrinsic characteristics of the detector remain unaffected by the multiplexing that significantly reduces the number of electronics channels.In parallel to the R\&D on the MM detector several contributions have been made in expanding and improving the efficiency and functionality of the ATLAS Muon Detector Control System (DCS). The two major developments that were realised concern the implementation of a calibration tool for the current offset of MDT high voltage channels using ATLAS luminosity data and a complete and independent DCS for the monitoring of the muon end-cap alignment system. Both developments are integrated into the ATLAS DCS and are used on the regular operation of the ATLAS detector. The initial idea of the current calibration tool, that uses the luminosity data, has been expanded towards developing a technique that can calculate the ATLAS luminosity using the MDT high voltage current data.},

As a result, scientists, institutions, and funding agencies have recently been pushing for the development of methodologies and tools that preserve software artifacts. Despite current efforts, long term reproducibility still eludes us. In this paper, we present the requirements for software execution preservation and discuss how to improve long-term reproducibility in science. In particular, we discuss the reasons why preserving binaries and pre-built execution environments is not enough and why preserving the ability to replicate results is not the same as preserving software for reproducible science. Finally, we show how these requirements are supported by Occam, an open curation framework that fully preserves software and its dependencies from source to execution, promoting transparency, longevity, and re-use.

Avoiding metaphoric imitations its colourful graphic language is mostly non-representational. The pros and cons of both interface design approaches have been discussed in the interface design community ever since. Apart from aesthetic judgements, especially the question of usability and learnability has been debated heatedly. In this paper the theoretical concepts that are relevant for usability and learnability discussion, and a survey on how the interfaces' reception changed over time, will be presented.},

Overall, results showed positive findings with respect to all three types of learning outcomes: students gained conceptual knowledge, were engaged in the lab, and were satisfied with learning in a remote lab context. However, evaluation approaches of the learning outcomes were quite superficial, because examining the educational benefits of the remote labs was not the main focus of most articles.

  abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic has brought uncertainty in educational response, skilling methods, and training practices among teachers and institutions. Even before the pandemic shutdowns, the incorporation of virtual laboratories within classroom education had brought transformations in teaching laboratory courses. Virtual laboratories were integrated as training platforms for complementing learning objectives in laboratory education especially during this pandemic imposed shutdown. In context of suspended face-to-face teaching, this study explores the role of virtual laboratories as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) in ensuring the continuity of teaching\textendash learning, providing alternative ways for skill training from home. As an innovative approach, the study presents push\textendash pull mooring theory to analyze switching intention of users from offline conventional education to online education. The study explores the complements of physical experiments brought in with animations, simulations, and remote laboratory set-ups for providing skill trainings to learners. To test whether virtualization techniques have global impact in education sector, the study included a comparative analysis of student users during the academic year 2019 (before-COVID) who had a blended approach of learning and those of the year 2020 (post-COVID), with remote learning. Initial before-COVID behavioral analysis on university students (n\,=\,1059) indicated the substantial popularity of virtual laboratories in education for skill training and instructor dependency. Usage adoption of virtual laboratories increased during the pandemic-imposed lockdowns and learners were being less instructor dependent. 24\% of students accessed more 10 times a week without the instructor being present and overall, 90\% contributed to a minimum of 5 usages a week. In terms of Kolb's learning styles, most of the virtual laboratory learners were assimilators. The results suggest virtual laboratories may have a prominent role in inquiry based and self-guided education with minimum instructor dependency, which may be crucial for complementing practice skills and planning online tools to add to this post-COVID-19 teaching and learning scenarios.},

Total energies of the ground states and some excited states are calculated with a density- and starting-energy-dependent effective interaction, including rearrangement effects. The absolute values of the binding energies and the general trend of their isotope dependence are well reproduced for nuclei up to 16Be and 17B. It is found that not only the density- and starting-energy-dependence of the effective interaction, but also the spin-orbit potential has important effects on the particle stability of n-rich nuclei, especially, extremely n-rich nuclei. It is also found that the {$\alpha$}-{$\alpha$} cluster structure as a core persists in these isotopes, especially in non-normal parity states. The spin-orbit potential reduces clustering in nuclei up to the neutron-closed shell nucleus and, on the other hand, it enhances clustering in extremely n-rich nuclei. Our model easily reproduces the non-normal parity states of 9Be(1/21+: 1.68 MeV) and 11Be(1/2+: ground state) in very low energy regions and is useful for explanation of low-lying level structure of Be and B isotopes.},

University of Westminster students on Bioscience courses have a variable range of laboratory competencies, reflecting the diversity of their entry qualifications; some students have had little experience within laboratories whilst others may be undertaking work-based learning. Science practical classes frequently require students to work in groups where unprepared or unconfident students may hide behind peers and not fully hone their practical skills. Equipment and reagents in cutting-edge areas of the Molecular Biosciences are prohibitively expensive and sometimes hazardous for use in large undergraduate classes. Often molecular bioscience experiments run over consecutive days and cannot be adapted to the short slots available within a timetable. Students in work-based learning environments will have standard operating procedures aligned with their workplace. Virtual practicals provide a simulated laboratory environment where students can have 24h access to laboratory equipment usually not widely available for undergraduate students and can make mistakes safely. The virtual laboratory simulations provide uniformity for all students on a course and the questions within the simulations, which must be answered before the user can progress, challenge the student to understand the underlying scientific theory. Overview: Here we report on the use of commercially available ``Labster'' virtual practicals for the first time in various undergraduate Bioscience modules at University of Westminster. We have used Likert-response surveys to determine whether the use of these virtual laboratories has increased the student understanding and engagement within modules. Results: The majority of students have reported that the use of virtual practicals has increased understanding within modules. Conclusion: We would recommend the continued use of these Labster simulations, students have reported that the 24h availability of the simulations was beneficial as was the ability to access them remotely. We have found student engagement to be greatest where the virtual simulations were closely aligned to module Learning Outcomes.},

It is found that neutron-induced reactions can cause discharges in some drift gas mixtures that are stable in the absence of the neutron beam. The discharges result from recoil ions close to the MICROMEGAS that deposit high specific ionization density and have a limited diffusion time. And for a binary drift gas, increasing the percentage of the molecular component (quench gas) relative to the noble component and operating at lower pressures generally improves stability.},

The research was focused on the member states of the European Union (EU). The data, provided by Eurostat, included the daily use of computers for the last three months and the average use of the Internet at least once per week. The findings state that the EU already faces the problem of digital inequality to an extended rate, since there are significant disparities among the European countries with regard to the aforementioned variables.},

The Fano factor F calculated in an uncorrelated final-state "shot-glass" model does not give an accurate answer even with the exact gap-distribution statistics. Allowing for the nearest-neighbor correlation effects gives a correction to F that brings F very close to its exact value. We discuss the implications of our results for energy resolution of semiconductor gamma detectors, where the value of F is of the essence. We argue that F is controlled by correlations in the cascade energy branching process and hence the widely used final-state model estimates are not reliable -- especially in the practically relevant cases when the energy branching is terminated by competition between impact ionization and phonon emission.},

By applying a generalized molecular orbital model to the linear-chain state of 14C, we confirm the 10Be+{$\alpha$} correlation.},

For the valence neutrons a concept based on molecular orbitals can be used for their single particle wave functions. Covalent binding between {$\alpha$}-particles due to valence neutrons and a related shallow local potential is now known to be responsible for particular structures in light neutron rich nuclei, like dimers in Be-isotopes, and trimers in C-isotopes. A local potential as between two {$\alpha$}-particles can be defined between other clusters, for example between {$\alpha$}-particles and 16O, giving rise to intrinsic reflection asymmetric molecular structures in 21Ne as parity doublets.

States close to the decay thresholds are of particular interest, as clustering becomes dominant. Recent studies of loosely bound light neutron-rich nuclei have focused attention on structures based on clusters and additional valence neutrons, which give rise to covalent molecular binding effects. These nuclear molecules appear only at the extremes of deformation, in the deformed shell model they are referred to as super- and hyper-deformed. The beryllium isotopes provide the first examples of such states in nuclear physics. Further nuclear molecules consisting of unequal cores and also with three centres can be considered. These arise in the isotopes of neon and carbon, respectively. Molecular states in intrinsically asymmetric configurations give rise to parity (inversion) doublets. Examples of recent experiments demonstrating the molecular structure of the rotational bands in beryllium isotopes are presented. Further experimental evidence for bands as parity doublets in nuclei with valence neutrons in molecular orbits is also analysed. Work on chain states (nuclear polymers) in the carbon isotopes is discussed. These are the first examples of hyper-deformed structures in nuclei with an axis ratio of 3:1. Future perspectives are outlined based on a threshold diagram for covalent nuclear molecules with clusters bound via neutrons in covalent molecular configurations.},

Further we list states of prolate shape which have no simple structure related to the low-lying oblate states of 12C. These are proposed to have strong \$\textbackslash alpha\$-clustering and to form rotational bands as a parity inversion doublet, with high moment of inertia.

Chemical molecules having a linear alignment are commonly seen in nature, such as carbon dioxide. A similar linear alignment of the nuclear clusters, referred to as linear-chain cluster state (LCCS), has been studied since the 1950s, however, up to now there is no clear experimental evidence demonstrating the existence of such a state. Recently, it was proposed that an excess of neutrons may offer just such a stabilizing mechanism, revitalizing interest in the nuclear LCCS, specifically with predictions for their emergence in neutron-rich carbon isotopes. Here we present the experimental observation of -cluster states in the radioactive C nucleus. Using the resonant scattering method with a radioactive beam, we observed a series of levels which completely agree with theoretically predicted levels having an explicit linear-chain cluster configuration. We regard this as the first strong indication of the linear-chain clustered nucleus.},
