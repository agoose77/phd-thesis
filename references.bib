  abstract = {A new nuclear model is proposed that describes the cluster and the shell structures unifiedly. By the present model one can investigate characteristics of one-particle orbitals in clustering states and also polarizations of constituent clusters. The model has its base on the Hartree-Fock (H. F.) approximation for nuclear intrinsic states. The basis wave functions used in the present H. F. calculations are constructed from single-particle wave functions around each ``cluster center'', which can well describe possible large eccentric nuclear deformations in light nuclei. The model is analogous to the LCAO-MO-SCF method in the molecular physics. Numerical calculations are performed using an effective two-nucleon force (Volkov No. 1) for the ground states of 8Be and 12C nuclei, and interesting results are obtained about the stability of {$\alpha$}-cluster structures. Polarizations are smallest at the equilibrium distance between {$\alpha$}-clusters, determined by Brink's {$\alpha$}-particle model. An artifical collapse or an extreme decomposition of the {$\alpha$}-cluster structures brings about large polarizations. By those polarizations of constituent {$\alpha$}-clusters themselves, the {$\alpha$}-cluster structure recovers their density distributions. Comparisons of the results are made with those of two-center shell model, usual H. F. calculation and {$\alpha$}-particle model.},

They interact via a combination of a Skyrme type potential and a Uehling-Uhlenbeck two-body scattering mechanism. This theory keeps track of the correlations and therefore allows for a selfconsistent theoretical description of the entire complex dynamics of heavy ion collisions, from the initial non-equilibrium penetration stage via the high density phase to the final formation of complex \textemdash{} stable and unstable \textemdash{} fragments. The cluster formation is caused by correlations and density fluctuations. We find that global equilibrium is not established in the course of the reaction. The form of the mass yield curve agrees with experimental findings. We also study the recently observed collective flow effects and find a strong dependence on the nuclear equation of state.},

A new method of calculating these quantities is advanced. In it a pair-number probability distribution pn(E), the probability that a particle with energy E ultimately creates n pairs, is calculated recursively with increasing E. The first and second moments of the pn(E) distribution yield {$\epsilon$}, F, and the quantum yield as functions of {$\hslash\omega$}0, Eg, and a parameter A, proportional to the ratio of the matrix elements for electron scattering by phonon emission and by ionization. We find that a single value of A, which fits the {$\epsilon$} observed for Si, gives values for these quantities in good accord with experiments for many semiconductors. The calculated {$\epsilon$} is found insensitive in many semiconductors to electron-energy loss to plasmons and to differences in the threshold energy for ionization representing real band-structure features. The assumption that all possible sets of product particles are equally probable in each scattering event leads to ultimate nonuniform population of the states with energies below the threshold for ionization, in contrast to the uniform population assumed in some earlier approaches. Results of other existing approaches in which the final-state distribution is calculated, an alternate method, were duplicated using this new method. A simple paradigm is used to illustrate these methods and assumptions.},

  abstract = {Phys. Rev. C 95, 064318 (2017) The decay properties of the linear-chain states in \textsuperscript{14\$}C are investigated by using the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics. The calculation predicts two rotational bands with linear-chain configurations having the {$\pi$}-bond and {$\sigma$}-bond valence neutrons. For the {$\pi$}-bond linear-chain, the calculated excitation energies and the widths of {$\alpha$}-decay to the ground state of \$\^10\textbackslash rm Be\$ reasonably agree with the experimental candidates observed by the \$\textbackslash alpha+\^10\textbackslash rm Be\$ resonant scattering. On the other hand, the {$\sigma$}-bond linear-chain is the candidate of the higher-lying resonant states reported by the break-up reaction. As the evidence of the {$\sigma$}-bond linear-chain, we discuss its decay pattern. It is found that the {$\sigma$}-bond linear-chain not only decays to the excited band of \$\^10\textbackslash rm Be\$ but also decays to the three-body channel of \$\^6\textbackslash rm He+\textbackslash alpha+\textbackslash alpha\$, and the branching ratio of these decays are comparable. Hence, we suggest that this characteristic decay pattern is a strong signature of the linear-chain formation and a key observable to distinguish two different linear-chains.},

These measurements were used to investigate F-18 and Ti-(44,48,52) respectively. In both experiments the Thick Target Inverse Kinematics technique was used and the analysis focused on the investigation of alpha-clustering. The measurements of He-4(N-14,a) and He-4(N-14,d)O-16 were performed between Ex[F-18] = 5.5 \textendash{} 16 MeV, and evaluated using a full R-matrix analysis up to 9 MeV. From this nine new states in F-18 were extracted and the alpha-cluster structure of F-18 was explored by comparison with nuclear models. The measurements of He-4(Ca-40,a), He-4(Ca-44,a) and He-4(Ca-48,a) were made over the ranges Ex[T-44] = 9 \textendash{} 17 MeV, Ex[Ti-48] = 13.5 \textendash{} 24 MeV and Ex[Ti-52] = 12 \textendash{} 20 MeV. The experimental data were analysed using a novel technique developed in this thesis for the identification of fragmented alpha-clustered states, known as the spectral signature analysis. From this analysis nine such states were identified in Ti-44, in good agreement with previous work. None were identified in Ti-48 and three in Ti-52. The implications of these results for alpha-clustering in the fp-shell are discussed.},

Various approaches of the superdeformed and hyperdeformed bands associated with quasimolecular resonant structures are presented. Evolution of clustering from stability to the drip-lines is examined: clustering aspects are, in particular, discussed for light exotic nuclei with large neutron excess such as neutron-rich Oxygen isotopes with their complete spectroscopy.},

A common constraint is that the labels should vary smoothly almost everywhere while preserving sharp discontinuities that may exist, e.g., at object boundaries. These tasks are naturally stated in terms of energy minimization. The authors consider a wide class of energies with various smoothness constraints. Global minimization of these energy functions is NP-hard even in the simplest discontinuity-preserving case. Therefore, our focus is on efficient approximation algorithms. We present two algorithms based on graph cuts that efficiently find a local minimum with respect to two types of large moves, namely expansion moves and swap moves. These moves can simultaneously change the labels of arbitrarily large sets of pixels. In contrast, many standard algorithms (including simulated annealing) use small moves where only one pixel changes its label at a time. Our expansion algorithm finds a labeling within a known factor of the global minimum, while our swap algorithm handles more general energy functions. Both of these algorithms allow important cases of discontinuity preserving energies. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for image restoration, stereo and motion. On real data with ground truth, we achieve 98 percent accuracy.},

The nuclear wave function has both strong short-range correlations and long-range contributions. Natural orbitals provide a means of adapting the single-particle basis for ab initio no-core configuration interaction (NCCI) calculations to better match the many-body wave function. Natural orbitals are obtained by diagonalizing the one-body density matrix from a calculation using an initial single-particle reference basis, such as the traditional harmonic oscillator basis. The natural orbital basis builds in contributions from high-lying oscillator shells, thus accelerating convergence of wave functions, energies, and other observables. The convergence of the ground and excited state energies, radii, and electromagnetic observables of He, Li, and Be isotopes calculated using natural orbitals in ab initio NCCI calculations is discussed. It is found that electromagnetic observables involving the M1 operator fully converge, while the calculated energies, radii, and observables involving the E2 operator converge significantly faster with the natural orbital basis than with the harmonic oscillator basis. The use of infrared (IR) extrapolation schemes with the natural orbital calculations is also explored.},

An energy with label costs can penalize a solution based on the set of labels that appear in it. The simplest special case is to penalize the number of labels in the solution. Our energy is quite general, and we prove optimality bounds for our algorithm. A natural application of label costs is multi-model fitting, and we demonstrate several such applications in vision: homography detection, motion segmentation, and unsupervised image segmentation.

RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

For example, intrinsic broadening occurs in x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements of heavy elements where the core-hole lifetime is very short. On the other hand, nonresonant x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) and other energy loss measurements are more limited by instrumental resolution. Here, we demonstrate that the Richardson-Lucy (RL) iterative algorithm provides a robust method for deconvolving instrumental and intrinsic resolutions from typical XAS and XRS data. For the K-edge XAS of Ag, we find nearly complete removal of \textasciitilde 9.3 eV FWHM broadening from the combined effects of the short core-hole lifetime and instrumental resolution. We are also able to remove nearly all instrumental broadening in an XRS measurement of diamond, with the resulting improved spectrum comparing favorably with prior soft x-ray XAS measurements. We present a practical methodology for implementing the RL algorithm to these problems, emphasizing the importance of testing for stability of the deconvolution process against noise amplification, perturbations in the initial spectra, and uncertainties in the core-hole lifetime.},

This allows a unifying description of alpha-conjugate and neutron-rich nuclei, alike. More sophisticated models of clusters are explored, such as antisymmetrized molecular dynamics. A number of contemporary topics in clustering are touched upon; the 3{$\alpha$}-cluster state in 12C, nuclear molecules and clustering at the drip-line. Finally, an understanding of the 12C+12C resonances in 24Mg, within the framework of the theoretical ideas developed in the review, is presented.},

This powerful combination soon found applications in other fields: at one extreme, for studies of rare events of simple structure; at the other, for heavy ion collisions, handling ever higher particle densities, finally up to several thousand tracks in a single event, still providing information on a track-to-track basis. Basic physics, performance and limitations of drift chambers in general will be discussed first. Then the characteristics of TPCs will be introduced, as well as their practical realization and performance. The development from the first TPC, 30 years ago, to the present day will be covered and followed by a few final comments on the ongoing studies for future applications.},

It is because of the flexible nature of the AMD wave function which can describe the formation and dissolution of clusters both in collision problems and in structure problems. After brief explanation of successful applications of AMD to heavy ion collisions and that of the frictional cooling technique for constructing minimum-energy wave functions, the results of the AMD analyses of Li, Be, and B isotopes are discussed. Very good reproduction of magnetic moments is obtained and is explained to be related with the structure-change between cluster structure and shell-model-like structure within each isotope. The superposition of AMD determinants is shown to reproduce neutron halo structure.},

Most existing methods, including generalizations of RANSAC, greedily search for models with most inliers (within a threshold) ignoring overall classification of points. We formulate geometric multi-model fitting as an optimal labeling problem with a global energy function balancing geometric errors and regularity of inlier clusters. Regularization based on spatial coherence (on some near-neighbor graph) and/or label costs is NP hard. Standard combinatorial algorithms with guaranteed approximation bounds (e.g. {$\alpha$}-expansion) can minimize such regularization energies over a finite set of labels, but they are not directly applicable to a continuum of labels, e.g. \$\{\textbackslash mathcal\{R\}\}\^\{2\}\$in line fitting. Our proposed approach (PEaRL) combines model sampling from data points as in RANSAC with iterative re-estimation of inliers and models' parameters based on a global regularization functional. This technique efficiently explores the continuum of labels in the context of energy minimization. In practice, PEaRL converges to a good quality local minimum of the energy automatically selecting a small number of models that best explain the whole data set. Our tests demonstrate that our energy-based approach significantly improves the current state of the art in geometric model fitting currently dominated by various greedy generalizations of RANSAC.},

It corresponds to a deformed mean field induced by a quadrupole interaction in a single major oscillator shell N and can be generalized to include several major shells. As such, Elliott's SU(3) model establishes the link between the spherical shell model and the (quadrupole component of the) geometric collective model. We introduce the analogue symmetry induced by an octupole interaction in two major oscillator shells and N, leading to an octupole-deformed solution of the spherical shell model. We show that in the limit of large oscillator shells, , the algebraic octupole interaction tends to that of the geometric collective model.},

This procedure is carried out by combining frameworks of the constraint cooling method introduced in Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics (AMD) and generator coordinate method (GCM). The resultant energy levels of 16O show that various effective interactions give the second 0+ state of 16O just around the 12C + {$\alpha$} threshold energy.

The model space employed is extended from the traditional MO models, and the orbits are expressed as linear combinations of local Gaussians. Their positions are determined variationally. Using this model, we reanalyze the structure of 9Be and show that this extension enables us to use the original two-body spin-orbit interaction determined from a scattering phase-shift analysis of {$\alpha-$}n. In 10Be, all of the observed positive-parity bands and the negative-parity bands are described within the model. The 0+ ground state of 10Be is described by a dominant (3/2-)2 configuration. The state has a rather large binding energy (8.38 MeV from the {$\alpha$}+{$\alpha$}+n+n threshold experimentally), and the mechanism leading to binding, such as a pairing effect and reduction of the kinetic energy between two clusters, is discussed in detail. In spite of this large binding, the {$\alpha-\alpha$} clustering in the ground state persists due to a coupling effect between the 6He+{$\alpha$} configuration and the 5He+5He configuration, which provides a smooth potential for the valence neutrons. The second 0+ state of 10Be has a large {$\alpha-\alpha$} structure with a (1/2+)2 configuration. An enlargement of the {$\alpha-\alpha$} distance due to two-valence neutrons along the {$\alpha-\alpha$} axis makes their wave function smooth and reduces the kinetic energy drastically. Furthermore, the contribution of the spin-orbit interaction due to coupling between the Sz=0 and the Sz=1 configurations is important. We also show the mediation effect of two valence neutrons between two {$\alpha$} clusters.},

The valence neutrons are classified based on the molecular-orbit model, and both {$\pi$} orbit and {$\sigma$} orbit are introduced around three {$\alpha$} clusters. The valence neutrons which occupy the {$\pi$} orbit increase the binding energy and stabilize the linear chain of 3{$\alpha$} against the breathinglike breakup. However, 14C with the {$\pi$} orbit does not show a clear energy minimum against the bendinglike path. The combination of the valence neutrons in the {$\pi$} and {$\sigma$} orbits is promising to stabilize the linear-chain state against the breathing and bending modes, and it is found that the excited states of 16C with the (3/2-{$\pi$})2(1/2-{$\sigma$})2 configuration for the four valence neutrons is one of the most promising candidates for such a structure.},

The book covers the elementary concepts of the subject necessary for introductory courses and also explores more advanced topics, suitable for graduate courses. Initially several models are described and used to explain nuclear properties with many illustrative examples. Sections follow on a-, B- and y-decay, fission, thermonuclear fusion, reactions, nuclear forces and nuclear collective motion. In each case many examples are discussed, and the student should gain a thorough grounding in knowledge of the nucleus. The presentation is quantitative and short derivations are given in full to enable the student to make predictions about nuclear phenomena. This book will be of value to all undergraduates studying nuclear physics, as well as to first-year graduates. The level of the presentation bridges the gap between introductory undergraduate and the more advanced graduate textbooks.},

When it is used for finding lines in a 3D-space, an appropriate line representation and quantisation of the parameter space is necessary. In this paper, we address the problem that a straightforward quantisation of the optimal four-parameter representation of a line after Roberts results in an inhomogeneous tessellation of the geometric space that introduces bias with respect to certain line orientations. We present a discretisation of the line directions via tessellation of an icosahedron that overcomes this problem whenever one parameter in the Hough space represents a direction in 3D (e.g. for lines or planes). The new method is applied to the detection of ridges and straight edges in laser scan data of buildings, where it performs better than a straightforward quantisation.}

The detector consists of a \$2.5 m\textbackslash times 2.3 m\textbackslash times 10.4 m\$ TPC including an array of 32 PMTs used for triggering and timing purposes. The TPC is housed in an evacuable and foam insulated cryostat vessel. It has a 2.5 m drift length in a uniform field up to 500 V/cm. There are 3 readout wire planes (U, V and Y co-ordinates) with a 3-mm wire pitch for a total of 8,256 signal channels. The fiducial mass of the detector is 60 metric tons of LAr. In a LArTPC, ionization electrons from a charged particle track drift along the electric field lines to the detection wire planes inducing bipolar signals on the U and V (induction) planes, and a unipolar signal collected on the (collection) Y plane. The raw wire signals are processed by specialized low-noise front-end readout electronics immersed in LAr which shape and amplify the signal. Further signal processing and digitization is carried out by warm electronics. We present the techniques by which the observed final digitized waveforms, which comprise the original ionization signal convoluted with detector field response and electronics response as well as noise, are processed to recover the original ionization signal in charge and time. The correct modeling of these ingredients is critical for further event reconstruction in LArTPCs.},

First the formulation of AMD including various refined versions is briefly presented and its characteristics are discussed, putting a stress on its nature as an ab initio theory.

Finally, we show the results of applications of AMD to unstable nuclei, from which we see that AMD is powerful in elucidating and understanding various types of nuclear structure of unstable nuclei.

Each of these techniques constructs a graph such that the minimum cut on the graph also minimizes the energy. Yet, because these graph constructions are complex and highly specific to a particular energy function, graph cuts have seen limited application to date. In this paper, we give a characterization of the energy functions that can be minimized by graph cuts. Our results are restricted to functions of binary variables. However, our work generalizes many previous constructions and is easily applicable to vision problems that involve large numbers of labels, such as stereo, motion, image restoration, and scene reconstruction. We give a precise characterization of what energy functions can be minimized using graph cuts, among the energy functions that can be written as a sum of terms containing three or fewer binary variables. We also provide a general-purpose construction to minimize such an energy function. Finally, we give a necessary condition for any energy function of binary variables to be minimized by graph cuts. Researchers who are considering the use of graph cuts to optimize a particular energy function can use our results to determine if this is possible and then follow our construction to create the appropriate graph.

This paper outlines a heuristic computer program for locating warehouses and compares it with recently published efforts at solving the problem either by means of simulation or as a variant of linear programing. The heuristic approach outlined in this paper appears to offer significant advantages in the solution of this class of problems in that it (1) provides considerable flexibility in the specification (modeling) of the problem to be solved, (2) can be used to study large-scale problems, that is, complexes with several hundred potential warehouse sites and several thousand shipment destinations, and (3) is economical of computer time. The results obtained in applying the program to small scale problems have been equal to or better than those provided by the alternative methods considered.},

C63 (2001) 024001 We present a charge-dependent nucleon-nucleon (NN) potential that fits the world proton-proton data below 350 MeV available in the year of 2000 with a chi\^2 per datum of 1.01 for 2932 data and the corresponding neutron-proton data with chi\^2/datum = 1.02 for 3058 data. This reproduction of the NN data is more accurate than by any phase-shift analysis and any other NN potential. The charge-dependence of the present potential (that has been dubbed `CD-Bonn') is based upon the predictions by the Bonn Full Model for charge-symmetry and charge-independence breaking in all partial waves with J {$<$}= 4. The potential is represented in terms of the covariant Feynman amplitudes for one-boson exchange which are nonlocal. Therefore, the off-shell behavior of the CD-Bonn potential differs in a characteristic and well-founded way from commonly used local potentials and leads to larger binding energies in nuclear few- and many-body systems, where underbinding is a persistent problem.},

  author = {Ntekas, Konstantinos and Alexopoulos, Theodoros},
  year = {2016},
  month = apr,
  abstract = {The ATLAS, an abbreviation for A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS, detector is one of the two general purpose high luminosity experiments (along with CMS) that have been built for probing p-p and Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions in the LHC. The muon spectrometer encircles the rest of the ATLAS detector subsystems defining the ATLAS overall dimensions. Its principle of operation is based on the magnetic deflection of muon tracks by a system of superconducting air-core toroid magnets providing high resolution muon momentum measurement. The upgrade of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is primarily motivated by the high background radiation expected during Run-3 (2021) and ultimately at \$\textbackslash mathcalL=7\textbackslash times 10\^34\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmcm\^-2s\^-1\$ in HL-LHC (2026). Owing to this the detectors that occupy the innermost muon station called Small Wheel (SW), MDT, CSC \& TGC, will go beyond their design luminosity limit. In addition, the muon trigger rate will exceed the available bandwidth because of the fake endcap muon triggers (\$90\%\$ is coming from low energy particles, generated in the material located between the Small Wheel and the outer endcap muon station). The collaboration has decided to replace the SW with a NSW system combining sTGC \& resistive MM detectors in order to maintain the excellent performance of the muon system beyond Run-2. Both detector technologies should provide tracking and triggering information for redundancy. The NSW will contribute to the suppression of fake triggers by reconstructing high quality \$\textbackslash left(\textbackslash sigma\_\th eta\textbackslash sim 1\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmmrad\textbackslash right)\$ IP pointing segments online. Moreover, efficient \& precise offline tracking (\$\textbackslash sigma\_r\textbackslash leq100\textbackslash,\textbackslash mu\textbackslash mathrmm\$) even for the maximum expected rate of \$15\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmkHz/cm\^2\$ is required. The NSW requires fully efficient high-rate capable MM chambers with a single plane spatial resolution better than \$100\textbackslash,\textbackslash mu\textbackslash mathrmm\$ independent of the track incidence angle and the magnetic field (\$B \textbackslash leq 0.3\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmT\$). Along with the precise tracking the MM should be able to provide a trigger signal, complementary to the sTGC, thus a decent timing resolution is required. In order to demonstrate and prove that the MM satisfy the NSW requirements several tests have been performed on small (\$10\textbackslash times10\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmcm\^2\$) resistive-strip MM chambers using medium (\$10\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmGeV/c\$) and high (\$150\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmGeV/c\$) momentum hadron beams at CERN and electron beam at DESY. The studies presented focus on the efficiency as well as hit and time reconstruction accuracy measured during these tests demonstrating the excellent characteristics of the MM. Exploiting the ability of the MM to work as a Time Projection Chamber a novel method, called the {$\mu$}TPC, has been developed for the case of inclined tracks, allowing for a precise segment reconstruction using a single detection plane. A detailed description of the method along with thorough studies towards refining the method's performance are shown. Moreover, owing to the moderate magnetic field expected in the NSW region (\$0.3\textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrmT\$), dedicated studies have been devoted in understanding the effect of the Lorentz force on the MM performance when operated inside a magnetic field. The effect of the field has been well understood using test beams, with chambers operated inside magnets, and in simulation. Owing to the quantitative agreement between simulation and test beam measurements the exact knowledge of the magnetic field value has become a prerequisite for a precise track reconstruction in the NSW Micromegas in order to correct for the field effect. Complementary to this, novel methods, for measuring the magnetic field using MM data, have been developed. Complementary to studying and optimising the MM performance, the use of readout geometries with different characteristics had been studied. The adoption of these schemes for the MM readout minimise the number of detection layers and electronic channels, decreasing the complexity, and make the application of Micromegas in large scale experiments feasible. The use of a stereo readout scheme, as foreseen for the NSW MM, allows for a two-dimensional hit position reconstruction with a decent accuracy. The validation of the stereo principle has been performed studying a medium size quadruplet prototype MM, following the NSW stereo readout scheme. Moreover, the possibility of multiplexing MM strips into a smaller number of electronic channels has been studied. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the multiplexing concept, proving that the excellent intrinsic characteristics of the detector remain unaffected by the multiplexing that significantly reduces the number of electronics channels.In parallel to the R\&D on the MM detector several contributions have been made in expanding and improving the efficiency and functionality of the ATLAS Muon Detector Control System (DCS). The two major developments that were realised concern the implementation of a calibration tool for the current offset of MDT high voltage channels using ATLAS luminosity data and a complete and independent DCS for the monitoring of the muon end-cap alignment system. Both developments are integrated into the ATLAS DCS and are used on the regular operation of the ATLAS detector. The initial idea of the current calibration tool, that uses the luminosity data, has been expanded towards developing a technique that can calculate the ATLAS luminosity using the MDT high voltage current data.},

Total energies of the ground states and some excited states are calculated with a density- and starting-energy-dependent effective interaction, including rearrangement effects. The absolute values of the binding energies and the general trend of their isotope dependence are well reproduced for nuclei up to 16Be and 17B. It is found that not only the density- and starting-energy-dependence of the effective interaction, but also the spin-orbit potential has important effects on the particle stability of n-rich nuclei, especially, extremely n-rich nuclei. It is also found that the {$\alpha$}-{$\alpha$} cluster structure as a core persists in these isotopes, especially in non-normal parity states. The spin-orbit potential reduces clustering in nuclei up to the neutron-closed shell nucleus and, on the other hand, it enhances clustering in extremely n-rich nuclei. Our model easily reproduces the non-normal parity states of 9Be(1/21+: 1.68 MeV) and 11Be(1/2+: ground state) in very low energy regions and is useful for explanation of low-lying level structure of Be and B isotopes.},

  abstract = {Correlation effects in in the fluctuation of the number of particles in the process of energy branching by sequential impact ionizations are studied using an exactly soluble model of random parking on a line. The Fano factor F calculated in an uncorrelated final-state "shot-glass" model does not give an accurate answer even with the exact gap-distribution statistics. Allowing for the nearest-neighbor correlation effects gives a correction to F that brings F very close to its exact value. We discuss the implications of our results for energy resolution of semiconductor gamma detectors, where the value of F is of the essence. We argue that F is controlled by correlations in the cascade energy branching process and hence the widely used final-state model estimates are not reliable -- especially in the practically relevant cases when the energy branching is terminated by competition between impact ionization and phonon emission.},

For the valence neutrons a concept based on molecular orbitals can be used for their single particle wave functions. Covalent binding between {$\alpha$}-particles due to valence neutrons and a related shallow local potential is now known to be responsible for particular structures in light neutron rich nuclei, like dimers in Be-isotopes, and trimers in C-isotopes. A local potential as between two {$\alpha$}-particles can be defined between other clusters, for example between {$\alpha$}-particles and 16O, giving rise to intrinsic reflection asymmetric molecular structures in 21Ne as parity doublets. An Extended Ikeda Diagram can be constructed based on these concepts with clusters and covalent neutrons.},

States close to the decay thresholds are of particular interest, as clustering becomes dominant. Recent studies of loosely bound light neutron-rich nuclei have focused attention on structures based on clusters and additional valence neutrons, which give rise to covalent molecular binding effects. These nuclear molecules appear only at the extremes of deformation, in the deformed shell model they are referred to as super- and hyper-deformed. The beryllium isotopes provide the first examples of such states in nuclear physics. Further nuclear molecules consisting of unequal cores and also with three centres can be considered. These arise in the isotopes of neon and carbon, respectively. Molecular states in intrinsically asymmetric configurations give rise to parity (inversion) doublets. Examples of recent experiments demonstrating the molecular structure of the rotational bands in beryllium isotopes are presented. Further experimental evidence for bands as parity doublets in nuclei with valence neutrons in molecular orbits is also analysed. Work on chain states (nuclear polymers) in the carbon isotopes is discussed. These are the first examples of hyper-deformed structures in nuclei with an axis ratio of 3:1. Future perspectives are outlined based on a threshold diagram for covalent nuclear molecules with clusters bound via neutrons in covalent molecular configurations.},

  abstract = {It is a well-known fact that a cluster of nucleons can be formed in the interior of an atomic nucleus, and such clusters may occupy molecular-like orbitals, showing characteristics similar to normal molecules consisting of atoms. Chemical molecules having a linear alignment are commonly seen in nature, such as carbon dioxide. A similar linear alignment of the nuclear clusters, referred to as linear-chain cluster state (LCCS), has been studied since the 1950s, however, up to now there is no clear experimental evidence demonstrating the existence of such a state. Recently, it was proposed that an excess of neutrons may offer just such a stabilizing mechanism, revitalizing interest in the nuclear LCCS, specifically with predictions for their emergence in neutron-rich carbon isotopes. Here we present the experimental observation of -cluster states in the radioactive C nucleus. Using the resonant scattering method with a radioactive beam, we observed a series of levels which completely agree with theoretically predicted levels having an explicit linear-chain cluster configuration. We regard this as the first strong indication of the linear-chain clustered nucleus.},
