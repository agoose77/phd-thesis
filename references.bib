It is shown that a resolution of tens of keV is practical at zero degrees, and that the dominant contribution to the resolution for large angles is angular straggling of the beam in the entrance window. The use of helium gas as the target allows direct measurement of alpha]-cluster states.},

	abstract = {The MicroBooNE experiment is designed to observe interactions of neutrinos with a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector from the on-axis Booster Neutrino Beam (BNB) and off-axis Neutrinos at the Main Injector (NuMI) beam at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. The detector consists of a \$2.5 m{\textbackslash}times 2.3 m{\textbackslash}times 10.4 m\$ TPC including an array of 32 PMTs used for triggering and timing purposes. The TPC is housed in an evacuable and foam insulated cryostat vessel. It has a 2.5 m drift length in a uniform field up to 500 V/cm. There are 3 readout wire planes (U, V and Y co-ordinates) with a 3-mm wire pitch for a total of 8,256 signal channels. The fiducial mass of the detector is 60 metric tons of LAr. In a LArTPC, ionization electrons from a charged particle track drift along the electric field lines to the detection wire planes inducing bipolar signals on the U and V (induction) planes, and a unipolar signal collected on the (collection) Y plane. The raw wire signals are processed by specialized low-noise front-end readout electronics immersed in LAr which shape and amplify the signal. Further signal processing and digitization is carried out by warm electronics. We present the techniques by which the observed final digitized waveforms, which comprise the original ionization signal convoluted with detector field response and electronics response as well as noise, are processed to recover the original ionization signal in charge and time. The correct modeling of these ingredients is critical for further event reconstruction in LArTPCs.},

	url = {https://www.openaire.eu/search?q=&Search=},
	abstract = {The ATLAS, an abbreviation for A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS, detector is one of the two general purpose high luminosity experiments (along with CMS) that have been built for probing p-p and Pb-Pb or p-Pb collisions in the LHC. The muon spectrometer encircles the rest of the ATLAS detector subsystems defining the ATLAS overall dimensions. Its principle of operation is based on the magnetic deflection of muon tracks by a system of superconducting air-core toroid magnets providing high resolution muon momentum measurement. The upgrade of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is primarily motivated by the high background radiation expected during Run-3 (2021) and ultimately at \${\textbackslash}mathcalL=7{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}34{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrmcm{\textasciicircum}-2s{\textasciicircum}-1\$ in HL-LHC (2026). Owing to this the detectors that occupy the innermost muon station called Small Wheel (SW), MDT, CSC \& TGC, will go beyond their design luminosity limit. In addition, the muon trigger rate will exceed the available bandwidth because of the fake endcap muon triggers (\$90\%\$ is coming from low energy particles, generated in the material located between the Small Wheel and the outer endcap muon station). The collaboration has decided to replace the SW with a NSW system combining sTGC \& resistive MM detectors in order to maintain the excellent performance of the muon system beyond Run-2. Both detector technologies should provide tracking and triggering information for redundancy. The NSW will contribute to the suppression of fake triggers by reconstructing high quality \${\textbackslash}left({\textbackslash}sigma\_þeta{\textbackslash}sim 1{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrmmrad{\textbackslash}right)\$ IP pointing segments online. Moreover, efficient \& precise offline tracking (\${\textbackslash}sigma\_r{\textbackslash}leq100{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathrmm\$) even for the maximum expected rate of \$15{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrmkHz/cm{\textasciicircum}2\$ is required. The NSW requires fully efficient high-rate capable MM chambers with a single plane spatial resolution better than \$100{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathrmm\$ independent of the track incidence angle and the magnetic field (\$B {\textbackslash}leq 0.3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrmT\$). Along with the precise tracking the MM should be able to provide a trigger signal, complementary to the sTGC, thus a decent timing resolution is required. In order to demonstrate and prove that the MM satisfy the NSW requirements several tests have been performed on small (\$10{\textbackslash}times10{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrmcm{\textasciicircum}2\$) resistive-strip MM chambers using medium (\$10{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrmGeV/c\$) and high (\$150{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrmGeV/c\$) momentum hadron beams at CERN and electron beam at DESY. The studies presented focus on the efficiency as well as hit and time reconstruction accuracy measured during these tests demonstrating the excellent characteristics of the MM. Exploiting the ability of the MM to work as a Time Projection Chamber a novel method, called the μTPC, has been developed for the case of inclined tracks, allowing for a precise segment reconstruction using a single detection plane. A detailed description of the method along with thorough studies towards refining the method's performance are shown. Moreover, owing to the moderate magnetic field expected in the NSW region (\$0.3{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrmT\$), dedicated studies have been devoted in understanding the effect of the Lorentz force on the MM performance when operated inside a magnetic field. The effect of the field has been well understood using test beams, with chambers operated inside magnets, and in simulation. Owing to the quantitative agreement between simulation and test beam measurements the exact knowledge of the magnetic field value has become a prerequisite for a precise track reconstruction in the NSW Micromegas in order to correct for the field effect. Complementary to this, novel methods, for measuring the magnetic field using MM data, have been developed. Complementary to studying and optimising the MM performance, the use of readout geometries with different characteristics had been studied. The adoption of these schemes for the MM readout minimise the number of detection layers and electronic channels, decreasing the complexity, and make the application of Micromegas in large scale experiments feasible. The use of a stereo readout scheme, as foreseen for the NSW MM, allows for a two-dimensional hit position reconstruction with a decent accuracy. The validation of the stereo principle has been performed studying a medium size quadruplet prototype MM, following the NSW stereo readout scheme. Moreover, the possibility of multiplexing MM strips into a smaller number of electronic channels has been studied. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the multiplexing concept, proving that the excellent intrinsic characteristics of the detector remain unaffected by the multiplexing that significantly reduces the number of electronics channels.In parallel to the R\&D on the MM detector several contributions have been made in expanding and improving the efficiency and functionality of the ATLAS Muon Detector Control System (DCS). The two major developments that were realised concern the implementation of a calibration tool for the current offset of MDT high voltage channels using ATLAS luminosity data and a complete and independent DCS for the monitoring of the muon end-cap alignment system. Both developments are integrated into the ATLAS DCS and are used on the regular operation of the ATLAS detector. The initial idea of the current calibration tool, that uses the luminosity data, has been expanded towards developing a technique that can calculate the ATLAS luminosity using the MDT high voltage current data.},

These measurements were used to investigate F-18 and Ti-(44,48,52) respectively. In both experiments the Thick Target Inverse Kinematics technique was used and the analysis focused on the investigation of alpha-clustering. The measurements of He-4(N-14,a) and He-4(N-14,d)O-16 were performed between Ex[F-18] = 5.5 – 16 MeV, and evaluated using a full R-matrix analysis up to 9 MeV. From this nine new states in F-18 were extracted and the alpha-cluster structure of F-18 was explored by comparison with nuclear models. The measurements of He-4(Ca-40,a), He-4(Ca-44,a) and He-4(Ca-48,a) were made over the ranges Ex[T-44] = 9 – 17 MeV, Ex[Ti-48] = 13.5 – 24 MeV and Ex[Ti-52] = 12 – 20 MeV. The experimental data were analysed using a novel technique developed in this thesis for the identification of fragmented alpha-clustered states, known as the spectral signature analysis. From this analysis nine such states were identified in Ti-44, in good agreement with previous work. None were identified in Ti-48 and three in Ti-52. The implications of these results for alpha-clustering in the fp-shell are discussed.},

This reproduction of the NN data is more accurate than by any phase-shift analysis and any other NN potential. The charge-dependence of the present potential (that has been dubbed `CD-Bonn') is based upon the predictions by the Bonn Full Model for charge-symmetry and charge-independence breaking in all partial waves with J {\textless}= 4. The potential is represented in terms of the covariant Feynman amplitudes for one-boson exchange which are nonlocal. Therefore, the off-shell behavior of the CD-Bonn potential differs in a characteristic and well-founded way from commonly used local potentials and leads to larger binding energies in nuclear few- and many-body systems, where underbinding is a persistent problem.},

A similar linear alignment of the nuclear clusters, referred to as linear-chain cluster state (LCCS), has been studied since the 1950s, however, up to now there is no clear experimental evidence demonstrating the existence of such a state. Recently, it was proposed that an excess of neutrons may offer just such a stabilizing mechanism, revitalizing interest in the nuclear LCCS, specifically with predictions for their emergence in neutron-rich carbon isotopes. Here we present the experimental observation of -cluster states in the radioactive C nucleus. Using the resonant scattering method with a radioactive beam, we observed a series of levels which completely agree with theoretically predicted levels having an explicit linear-chain cluster configuration.

When it is used for ﬁnding lines in a 3D-space, an appropriate line representation and quantisation of the parameter space is necessary. In this paper, we address the problem that a straightforward quantisation of the optimal four-parameter representation of a line after Roberts results in an inhomogeneous tessellation of the geometric space that introduces bias with respect to certain line orientations. We present a discretisation of the line directions via tessellation of an icosahedron that overcomes this problem whenever one parameter in the Hough space represents a direction in 3D (e.g. for lines or planes). The new method is applied to the detection of ridges and straight edges in laser scan data of buildings, where it performs better than a straightforward quantisation.},

	abstract = {Phys. Rev. C 95, 064318 (2017) The decay properties of the linear-chain states in $^{\textrm{14\$}}$C are investigated by using the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics. The calculation predicts two rotational bands with linear-chain configurations having the π-bond and σ-bond valence neutrons. For the π-bond linear-chain, the calculated excitation energies and the widths of α-decay to the ground state of \${\textasciicircum}10{\textbackslash}rm Be\$ reasonably agree with the experimental candidates observed by the \${\textbackslash}alpha+{\textasciicircum}10{\textbackslash}rm Be\$ resonant scattering. On the other hand, the σ-bond linear-chain is the candidate of the higher-lying resonant states reported by the break-up reaction. As the evidence of the σ-bond linear-chain, we discuss its decay pattern. It is found that the σ-bond linear-chain not only decays to the excited band of \${\textasciicircum}10{\textbackslash}rm Be\$ but also decays to the three-body channel of \${\textasciicircum}6{\textbackslash}rm He+{\textbackslash}alpha+{\textbackslash}alpha\$, and the branching ratio of these decays are comparable. Hence, we suggest that this characteristic decay pattern is a strong signature of the linear-chain formation and a key observable to distinguish two different linear-chains.},

The detector is designed to be of general use for nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics experiments with rare isotope beams. TexAT combines a highly segmented Time Projection Chamber (TPC) with two layers of solid state detectors. It provides high efficiency and flexibility for experiments with low intensity exotic beams, allowing for the 3D track reconstruction of the incoming and outgoing particles involved in nuclear reactions and decays.},

	abstract = {Intrinsic and experimental mechanisms frequently lead to broadening of spectral features in excited-state spectroscopies. For example, intrinsic broadening occurs in x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurements of heavy elements where the core-hole lifetime is very short. On the other hand, nonresonant x-ray Raman scattering (XRS) and other energy loss measurements are more limited by instrumental resolution. Here, we demonstrate that the Richardson-Lucy (RL) iterative algorithm provides a robust method for deconvolving instrumental and intrinsic resolutions from typical XAS and XRS data. For the K-edge XAS of Ag, we find nearly complete removal of {\textasciitilde}9.3 eV FWHM broadening from the combined effects of the short core-hole lifetime and instrumental resolution. We are also able to remove nearly all instrumental broadening in an XRS measurement of diamond, with the resulting improved spectrum comparing favorably with prior soft x-ray XAS measurements. We present a practical methodology for implementing the RL algorithm to these problems, emphasizing the importance of testing for stability of the deconvolution process against noise amplification, perturbations in the initial spectra, and uncertainties in the core-hole lifetime.},

	abstract = {The time projection chamber (TPC) was originally proposed to permit full reconstruction of events of up to 20 particles at an electron–positron collider. It was intended to provide 3D information for tracking and momentum measurement together with particle identification by multiple ionization sampling, in a compact detector. This powerful combination soon found applications in other fields: at one extreme, for studies of rare events of simple structure; at the other, for heavy ion collisions, handling ever higher particle densities, finally up to several thousand tracks in a single event, still providing information on a track-to-track basis. Basic physics, performance and limitations of drift chambers in general will be discussed first. Then the characteristics of TPCs will be introduced, as well as their practical realization and performance. The development from the first TPC, 30 years ago, to the present day will be covered and followed by a few final comments on the ongoing studies for future applications.},
